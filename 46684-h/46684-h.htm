<h2 id="BIETRIXS_VERTICAL_AND_HORIZONTAL_COMPOUND_ENGINE">BIETRIX'S VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL COMPOUND ENGINE.</h2>

<p>Compound engines are tending to come more and more
into use, inasmuch as they present many advantages over
other kinds, especially as regards the saving they effect in
fuel, and their great regularity, due to the adjusting of the
cranks at right angles.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, then, to see our large manufacturers,
who desire to maintain a reputation, seeking to create new
types based upon this principle. But, in multiplying the
parts, as is done in these motors, the engine is rendered more
complicated, and the cost of installation is increased.
Hence the difficulty of placing these motors, notwithstanding
the saving in fuel that is gained by employing them.</p>

<p>Messrs. Bietrix &amp; Co., of St. Etienne, however, have
devised a type in which these two inconveniences seem to
have been in a great measure overcome, and which we illustrate
in the annexed engraving.</p>

<div class="figcenter w100">

<p class="caption">COMBINED VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL COMPOUND STEAM ENGINE.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Description of the Engine.</i>&mdash;The engine as a whole is represented
in longitudinal elevation in Fig. 1, in plan in Fig.
2, and in side view in Fig. 3. Fig. 4 shows the condenser
in transverse section.</p>

<p>The motor consists of a small vertical cylinder, A, and of
a large horizontal one, C, both projecting over a strong
hollow frame, B, which connects them and carries the
guides, <i>g g'</i>, and the pillow block, P, of the driving shaft,
<i>p</i>. The condenser, D, is in a line with the large cylinder,
and the piston, D², of its pump is mounted upon the prolongation,
<i>d'</i>, of the piston rod, <i>a</i>, of the cylinder, C. The
expansion gear is controlled by the regulator, and the admission
may vary from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>19</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>85</sub>. Steam is admitted into the
small cylinder through the pipe, <i>s</i>, and its entrance may be
regulated at will by acting upon the hand wheel, <i>s'</i>, which
controls the maneuvering rod, <i>s²</i>. After expanding, the
steam, in escaping from the smaller cylinder, passes through
the pipe, <i>r</i>, into the feed-water heater, R, and then acts in
the larger cylinder, <i>c</i>, in order to pass afterward to the condenser,
D, through the pipe, <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>The frame, B, is in two parts, the vertical part being adjusted
by keys upon the horizontal one, and strong bolts
concurring with such a coupling to make the whole strong
and solid. This frame carries plane slide bars, <i>g g'</i>, with
beveled counter guides.</p>

<p>The pistons are of the Swedish type, of hollow iron, with
steel rods. The segments are of cast iron. The horizontal
connecting rod, M', is connected directly with the crank pin,
<i>m</i>, but the vertical one is fixed to the head of the former, as
may be seen in Figs. 3, 8, and 9.</p>

<p>The bearing of the horizontal connecting rod is in three
parts, each having an anti-frictional bushing, and their play
being regulated by bolts, <i>m²</i>. Friction being slight in the
bearing of the vertical rod, M, inasmuch as the latter's axis
has but a short travel at each revolution of the driving shaft,
it is not provided with an anti-frictional bushing.</p>

<p><i>The Small Cylinder</i> (Figs. 5 and 6).&mdash;The small cylinder is
shown in detail in Figs. 5 and 6, the valve box cover being
removed in the latter. The diameter of this cylinder is 380
millimeters, the stroke of the piston is 650 millimeters, and
the thickness of the sides is 25 millimeters. It is provided
with a steam jacket; and the two ports are 45 millimeters
in width by 200 in length. The exhaust is effected through
an orifice 84 millimeters in diameter.</p>

<p>The distribution is a variable one, according to the Meyer
system, the expansion being caused to vary automatically
in the small cylinder, by means of a regulator, so as to
proportion the motive to the resistant power.</p>

<p>The distributing slide valve, <i>t</i>, contains two steam inlets,
whose orifices facing the cylinder are formed by two horizontal,
parallel rectangles, while the inlets debouch toward
the opposite surface (in contact, consequently, with the
expansion slide valve, <i>t'</i>), according to two parallelograms,
whose larger sides are oblique, and form between them a
sharp angle, as may be seen in Fig. 6. These inlet conduits
are therefore out of true. The slide-valve, <i>t</i>, is moved by
an eccentric, E.</p>

<p>The expansion slide-valve, <i>t'</i>, has the form of a trapezium,
whose two like sides are parallel with the inclined openings
in the slide-valve, <i>t</i>. It is held by a piece, <i>q</i>, which carries
it along in its backward and forward motion, but does not
prevent it from being moved in a horizontal direction under
the action of the regulator. This piece, <i>q</i>, is keyed upon a
rod, <i>q'</i>, which is itself jointed at its lower extremity with the
rod, <i>e'</i>, of a second eccentric, E', which causes its vertical
motion.</p>

<p>The backs of the valve, <i>t</i>, and the piece, <i>q</i>, are provided with
grooves, which are designed for giving passage to the steam,
the pressure of which on these surfaces partially balances
that that it exerts in an opposite direction.</p>

<p><i>Automatic Regulation</i> (Figs 5 and 6).&mdash;The upper part of
the rod, <i>e'</i>, carries a cam, <i>f</i>, that plays freely between two
connecting rods, <i>f¹</i>, and the travel of which is limited by two
rollers, <i>f²</i> and <i>f³</i>, situated between the rods, <i>f</i>, which latter
are themselves suspended from a rod, F. The latter slides
in a support, F², which serves likewise as a guide to the
rods, <i>q'</i> and <i>t²</i>, of the slide-valves, and which is fixed upon a
projection cast in a piece with the frame, B, and is suspended
from the short arm of a bent lever, F', whose longer arm
carries a roller that runs in a vertical groove, <i>t³</i>, in the back
of the expansion slide-valve. The lower extremity of the
connecting rods, <i>f'</i>, is connected with the sleeve of the regulator,
Q, by a lever, <span class="nobr"><i>f<sup>4</sup></i></span>, and a bent lever, Q'. This latter
revolves on an axis passing through its elbow and mounted
at the extremity of a projection that is cast in a piece with
the support of the regulator. This bent lever is prolonged
beyond the sleeve, and carries suspended from its extremity
a small piston-rod that plays in a dash pot, Q³, and limits
the too abrupt motions of the apparatus. The regulator is
driven by a belt and through the intermedium of the bevel
pinions, <i>u</i>.</p>

<p>It is easy now to understand the purpose and the <i xml:lang="la">modus
operandi</i> of the mechanism that permits the regulator to act
upon the expansion gear. When running normally the connecting-rods,
<i>f'</i>, occupy a vertical position, and the rollers,
<i>f²</i> and <i>f³</i>, are placed exactly at the two extremities of the
travel of the cam, <i>f</i>.</p>

<p>When the velocity exceeds the normal, the sleeve of the
regulator rises and the lever, Q', tips to the right and forces
the rods, <i>f'</i>, to oscillate in the same direction around their
upper joint. After that, the lower roller, <i>f²</i>, being situated
on the line of travel of the convex part of the cam, will be
carried along by the latter and cause an oscillation to the
right of the bent lever, F. The piece, <i>t'</i>, will then be
pushed back in such a way as to partially close the inlet orifices
of the slide-valve, <i>t</i>, and, as the steam will thereupon
enter into less quantity, the engine will quickly resume its
normal velocity. If the velocity becomes less that the normal
the action will be just the opposite of that just described.</p>

<p><i>The Large Cylinder</i> (Figs. 1 and 2).&mdash;The two eccentrics,
E and E', which control the distributing gear of the small
cylinder, A, actuate at the same time that of the large one,
C, through two rods, <i>e²</i> and <i>e³</i>; such distribution is also
effected by means of a sliding-plate valve. The two steam
ports are 45 millimeters and the exhaust port 84 millimeters
in diameter.</p>

<p>The large cylinder is 650 millimeters in diameter, and 930
in length. The stroke of the piston is 650 millimeters.</p>

<p><i>The Feed-Water Heater</i> (Figs. 1 and 2).&mdash;The exhaust from
the small cylinder enters the heater through a pipe, <i>r</i>, 140
millimeters in diameter. This feed-water heater consists of a
large cast iron cylinder, 400 millimeters in internal diameter,
and 1.15 meters in length, connected with the pipe, <i>r</i>, on the
one hand, and with the cylinder, C, on the other, by means
of two couplings, R' and R². In its interior are arranged
60 copper tubes, of 29 millimeters internal, and 31½ millimeters
external diameter. These tubes are fixed at their
extremities into two circular supports that are riveted to
the interior of the cylinder. The exhaust from the small
cylinder passes into these tubes, around which circulates
steam coming directly from the boiler through the tube, <i>r'</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6440">6440</span>
and escapes toward the bottom, with the condensed water,
through the tube, <i>r²</i>. The heater is surrounded with a 2
mm. plate iron jacket.</p>

<p>A communication, <i>r³</i>, with a valve-cock, R³, permits of
the introduction, into the large cylinder, of the steam from
the heater. The exhaust steam from the large cylinder
goes directly to the condenser, but there is likewise provided
a pipe through which it may make its exit into the
open air, in case, for example, the condenser needs repairing
or there is a failure of water.</p>

<p><i>The Condenser</i> (Figs. 1, 2, and 4).&mdash;The condenser is represented,
half in section and half in external view and in
elevation in Fig. 1, and in plan in Fig. 2; Fig. 4 is a transverse
view of it. It consists of a large cast iron chest, D,
bolted by means of its flanged base to a masonry support.
This chest is cast in a piece with a pump chamber, D', in
which works a piston mounted on the prolongation, <i>d'</i>, of
the piston-rod of the cylinder, C. The diameter of this piston
is 210 millimeters, and its stroke is 650. The condensing
jet, whose flow is regulated by the cock, <i>d²</i>, is brought
into contact with the steam by a rose, <i>d³</i>, which divides it
into small drops.</p>

<p>The pump is a double acting one. Its valves are of rubber,
and the passage-way allowed the water is, in each of
them, in section, one-half that of the piston. The rod, <i>d'</i>,
slides in a stuffing-box, with metallic lining, which is shown
in Fig. 10.</p>

<p><i>Lubrication.</i>&mdash;The lubrication of the crank-pin presents
some peculiarities. Two stationary cups, <i>z</i>, are placed at
the upper part of the guides, as seen in Fig. 3. These distribute
their oil, drop by drop, into two reservoirs, <i>z'</i>, fixed
to the upper axis of the vertical connecting-rod. Two small
brass tubes, resting against the connecting-rod, lead the
lubricator into cavities in the head of the horizontal connecting-rod,
M'. One of these cavities corresponds to the
crank-pin and the other to the lower axis of the vertical connecting-rod.
The lubrication of the cylinders is effected
automatically by means of a Consolin apparatus (Fig. 1),
based upon the condensation of the steam and upon the
difference between the density of the oil and condensed
water.</p>

<p><i>Diagram of Distribution</i> (Fig. 11).&mdash;We shall first examine
that which relates to the small cylinder. The eccentric of
the distributing slide-valves is adjusted to 123° with respect
to the crank, and that of the expansion slide-valves to 170°,
that is to say, so that the angles of advance are respectively
55 and 57 millimeters for these two cylinders.</p>

<p>Let us trace two axes, <i>o x</i> and <i>o y</i>, at right angles, and a
semi-circumference of any radius whatever, <i>o m</i>, which
shall represent the travel of the crank-pin. Let us draw the
line, <i>o</i> A, making with <i>o y</i> an angle of advance of 33°, and
the length of which is equal to the eccentricity of the distributing
slide-valve, say 55 millimeters, and let us describe
a circumference on this length taken as a diameter. Let us
trace in the same way the line, <i>o</i> B, making with <i>o y</i> an
angle of advance of 80°, and let us describe upon this line a
circumference equal in diameter to the eccentricity of the
distributing slide-valve, say 57 millimeters.</p>

<p>Finally, let us trace points, <i>o</i> and <i>c</i>, as centers of arcs of
circles having respectively for radii the distance between
the centers of the circumferences just mentioned and the
eccentricity of the expansion slide-valve. These two arcs
will intersect each other at a point, <i>c²</i>, which is thus the
fourth angle of a parallelogram whose other angles are the
points, <i>c</i>, <i>c'</i>, and <i>o</i>. From the point, <i>c²</i>, as a center let us
describe a circle passing through <i>o</i>.</p>

<p>In short, we obtain three circles that are such that the
vector radii, starting from the point, <i>o</i>, and limited at the
said circles, represent, for the first, the deviations to the
right of the distributing slide-valve beginning at the middle
of its travel, the second the deviations of the expansion
slide-valve, and the third the relative deviations of the distributing
with respect to the expansion slide-valve.</p>

<p>Let us complete the diagram by describing, from the
point, <i>o</i>, as a center, circumferences having for respective
radii the length, <i>o e</i>, of the external overlap of the distributing
slide-valve, and the lengths, <i>o i</i> and <i>o i'</i>, corresponding
to the minimum and maximum of the interval between one
of the edges of the expansion slide-valve and the external
edge of the corresponding inlet orifice of the distributing
slide-valve, when the axes of these two valves coincide.</p>

<p>These radii have the values: <i>o e</i> = 25 mm.; <i>o i</i> = 8 mm.;
and <i>o i'</i> = 42 mm. Let us now prolong the radii, <i>o d</i>, <i>o d'</i>,
<i>o d²</i>, and <i>o f</i>, until they meet the crank circle, and let us
then project these points of intersection upon a line, M M',
parallel with <i>o x</i>, and we shall have all the elements that are
necessary to study the different phases of the distribution in
the small cylinder.</p>

<p>Let us complete this diagram in such a way as to study
also the distribution in the large cylinder:</p>

<p>In this cylinder the distribution cannot be modified, that
is to say, the active length of the expansion slide-valve is
invariable. The interval comprised between one of the
edges of this valve and the internal edge of the corresponding
inlet orifice is equal, then, to 28 mm. when the axes of
the two valves coincide.</p>

<p>Let us describe, from <i>o</i> as a center, a circle having this
length for a radius, and let us again project the intersections
of the radius, <i>o k</i>, with the crank circle upon a parallel
at M M'. The external overlap, being the same as in the
small cylinder, say 25 millimeters, the circle, <i>o e</i>, already
traced for the distribution in the small cylinder, will serve
for the distribution in the large one. Let us join its intersection
with the circle, <i>c</i>, and the center, <i>o</i>, and let us trace
also the circle of the internal overlap and the radii, <i>o g</i>, and
<i>o h</i>, and we shall have all the elements of the distribution.</p>

<p><i>Advantages of the Engine.</i>&mdash;The engine that we have just
described presents all the advantages possessed by horizontal
motors and double cylinder vertical ones without their
many inconveniences. It, in fact, takes up less space than
the former, while it possesses more stability than the latter.
Its operation is as regular as that of an engine having two
cranks adjusted at right angles.</p>

<p>The cranked shaft, a costly member of an engine, and one
whose duration is always uncertain, despite the care that
has been taken in making it, is here done away with.</p>

<p>The kind of distribution adopted is well adapted to the
great variations in expansion, and, notwithstanding the two
superposed slide-valves in each cylinder, two eccentrics
suffice to operate them.</p>

<p>The regulator, thanks to the mechanism that connects it
with the expansion plate, is freed from all exaggerated resistance,
the eccentric rod alone supporting the entire stress.
The regulator is consequently very sensitive, and is capable
of giving a coefficient of regularity which is more than sufficient
in most cases. The condenser, with its wide apertures,
is capable of operating with great speed without
shock.</p>

<p>We may add to this that the engine is simple and compact;
the number of parts is few, and all can be easily got
at; the bearings are long, and the wear is consequently reduced;
the dimensions of the steam ports are wide and permit
of great velocities being reached without counter-pressures;
the mode of lubrication has been well studied, and
requires but little attention on the part of the engine man;
and, finally, the cylinder jackets and the superheating of
the steam after it has begun to expand make this an economical
motor aside from all the advantages that we have
enumerated.&mdash;<cite xml:lang="fr">Publication Industrielle.</cite></p>

<h2 id="IMPROVED_GAS_ENGINE">IMPROVED GAS ENGINE.</h2>

<p>The accompanying engravings illustrate Edwards' patent
gas engine, made by Messrs. Cobham &amp; Co., Stevenage,
Herts, recently exhibited at York. In our engravings, <i>a</i> is the
foundation plate of the engine, having the bearing, <i>b</i>, in which
the crank shaft, <i>c</i>, revolves; <i>d</i>, an inclined plate upon the foundation,
<i>a</i>, to which the cylinder, <i>e</i>, and casing, <i>f</i>, are bolted;
<i>g</i> is a piston working in the cylinder, <i>e</i>, and having a hollow
rod or trunk, <i>h</i>, to which is jointed the connecting rod, <i>i</i>,
which drives the crank pin, <i>k</i>. The guide, <i>l</i>, fits upon the
hollow trunk, <i>h</i>, and is itself surrounded by the air casing, <i>m</i>,
which communicates with the casing, <i>f</i>, through openings, <i>n n</i>,
in the inclined plate, <i>d</i>. The guide, <i>l</i>, has openings, <i>o o</i>,
through which air enters the casing, <i>m</i>, when the hollow
trunk, <i>h</i>, is at the inner end of its stroke; <i>p</i> is the exhaust
pipe, and <i>r</i> is a casing round the cylinder, <i>e</i>, through which
water may be made to circulate by pipes at <i>s, t</i>. The valve
seat, <i>v</i>, fits into the cylinder, <i>e</i>, and has holes, <i>w</i>, for the admission
of air, and <i>x</i> for the admission of gas through the central
pipe, <i>y</i>. The valve, <i>z</i>, consists of a disk of metal covering
these holes and guided by a spindle, A, the outer end of
which is fitted with a metal or India-rubber spring at B, and
a regulating nut, C. The gas pipe, <i>y</i>, is shown supplied
from a flexible bag, D, the supply to which from any convenient
source is regulated by a cock or valve at E. The
piston, <i>g</i>, contains a disk exhaust valve, G, the spindle, H, of
which is fitted with a closing spring, I, and the end of the
spindle is pressed down during the inner stroke of the piston
by a tail-piece, K, on the inner end of the connecting rod, <i>i</i>.
Holes, L, open from the hollow piston above the exhaust
valve, G, into the cylinder round the hollow trunk, <i>h</i>, and
thence to the exhaust pipe, <i>p</i>. At or near one-third of the
stroke of the piston a firing valve, P, is arranged, having an
inlet hanging valve of the usual kind, through which a flame
burning outside is drawn when the valve is uncovered by the
piston, <i>g</i>. The outer end of the casing, <i>f</i>, is closed by a cover,
R, to which the valve seat, <i>v</i>, and gas inlet pipe, <i>g</i>, are connected.</p>

<p>The operation of the engine is as follows: The piston, <i>g</i>,
being at the inner end of its stroke, the crank is turned
round in the direction of the arrow, and the piston draws air
in through the holes, <i>w</i>, and gas through the holes, <i>x</i>, the two
mixing as they pass under the inlet valve, <i>z</i>. When
the piston has advanced far enough to uncover the firing
valve, P, the flame is drawn in and the inflammable mixture
exploded, the expansion of the air and gas closing the inlet
valve, <i>z</i>, and carrying the piston to the end of the stroke.
The momentum of the fly-wheel then carries the piston back
through its return stroke, during which the tail-piece, K,
presses the spindle, H, and opens the exhaust valve, G,
through which expanded air and gas escape to the exhaust
pipe, <i>p</i>. It is claimed that this arrangement is very effective
in securing a complete clearance from the cylinder of the
products of combustion, which, when not wholly removed,
vitiate the incoming charge and reduce efficiency.</p>

<p>When the piston arrives at the inner end of its stroke, the
exhaust valve, G, is closed by the spring, I, and a fresh supply
of air and gas are drawn in through the inlet valve seat, <i>v</i>, as
the piston again commences its outer stroke. In order to keep
the cylinder, <i>e</i>, sufficiently cool, whether the water casing at
<i>r</i>, be used or not, the whole supply of air is drawn from the
front end of the cylinder through the openings, <i>n n</i>, and
thence between the cylinder, <i>e</i>, and the casing, <i>f</i>, and round
the end of the latter to the inlet valve, <i>v</i>. And in order to
prevent or lessen the noise of the explosions, the hollow
trunk, <i>h</i>, is made of such length that its front edge closes
the openings in the guide, <i>l</i>, through which air is drawn
into the air casing <i>m</i>, and through the openings, <i>n n</i>, just
before the explosion takes place, the noise of which therefore
cannot escape. For the same purpose fibrous or porous
material, such as mineral or slag wool, may be placed loosely
in the space between the cylinder and the casing, <i>f</i>.</p>

<p>The engine may be made to revolve in the opposite direction
to the arrow by turning the piston and connecting
rod round so that the tail-piece upon the latter is above
instead of below, and instead of the water casing, <i>r</i>, radial
ribs may be formed upon the cylinder, <i>e</i>, from which the air
passing between them inside the casing, <i>f</i>, absorbs the heat.
The cylinder is arranged preferably in the inclined position
shown, but it may, of course, be fixed in any other convenient
position.&mdash;<cite>Engineering.</cite></p>

By <span class="smcap">Mr. C. Vernon Boys</span>.</h2>

<p>The subject of this evening's discourse&mdash;"Meters for
Power and Electricity"&mdash;is unfortunately, from a lecturer's
point of view, one of extreme difficulty, for it is impossible to
fully describe any single instrument of the class without diving
into technical and mathematical niceties which this audience
might well consider more scientific than entertaining.
If, then, in my endeavor to explain these instruments and the
purposes which they are intended to fulfill, in language as
simple and untechnical as possible, I am not as successful
as you have a right to expect, I must ask you to lay some of
the blame on my subject and not all on myself.</p>

<p>I shall at once explain what I mean by the term "meter,"
and I shall take the flow of water in a trough as an illustration
of my meaning. If we hang in a trough a weighted board,
then, when the water flows past it, the board will be pushed
back; when the current of water is strong, the board will be
pushed back a long way; when the current is less, it will not
be pushed so far; when the water runs the other way, the
board will be pushed the other way. So by observing the position
of the board, we can tell how strong the current of water
is at any time. Now suppose we wish to know, not how strong
the current of water is at this time or at that, but how much
water altogether has passed through the trough during any
time, as, for instance, one hour. Then if we have no better
instrument than the weighted board, it will be necessary to
observe its position continuously to keep an exact record of
the corresponding rates at which the water is passing every
minute, or better every second, and to add up all the values
obtained. This would, of course, be a very troublesome
process.</p>

<p>There is another kind of instrument which may be used
to measure the flow of the water&mdash;a paddle wheel or screw.
When the water is flowing rapidly, the wheel will turn
rapidly; when slowly, the wheel will turn slowly; and when
the water flows the other way, the wheel will turn the other
way, so that if we observe how fast the wheel is turning we
can tell how fast the water is flowing. If, now, we wish to
know how much water altogether has passed through the
trough, the number of turns of the wheel, which may be
shown by a counter, will at once tell us. There are, therefore,
in the case of water, two kinds of instruments, one
which measures at a time, and the other during a time. The
term meter should be confined to instruments of the second
class only.</p>

<p>As with water so with electricity, there are two kinds of
measuring instruments, one of which, the galvanometer,
may be taken as a type, which shows by the position of a
magnet how strong a current of electricity is at a time; and
the other which shows how much electricity has passed during
any time. Of the first, which are well understood, I shall say
nothing; the second, the new electric meters and the corresponding
meters for power, are what I have to speak of to-night.
It is hardly necessary for me to mention the object of
making electric meters. Every one who has had to pay his
gas bill once a quarter probably quite appreciates what the
electric meters are going to do, and why they are at the
present time attracting so much attention. So soon as
you have electricity laid on in your houses, as gas
and water are laid on now, so soon will a meter of some
sort be necessary, in order that the companies which
supply the electricity may be able to make out their
quarterly bills, and refer complaining customers to the
faithful indications of their extravagance in the mysterious
cupboard in which the motor is placed. The urgent
necessity for a good meter has called such a host of
inventors into the field, that a complete account of their
labors is more than any one could hope to give in an hour.
Since I am one of this host, I hardly like to pick out those
inventions which I consider of value. I cannot describe all,
I cannot act as a judge and say, these only are worthy of
your attention; and I do not think I should be acting fairly
if I were to describe my own instruments only and ignore
those of every one else. The only way I see out of the difficulty
is to speak more particularly about my own work
in this direction, and to speak generally on the work of
others.</p>

<p>I must now ask you to give your attention for a few minutes
to a little abstract geometry. We may represent any
changing quantity, as, for instance, the strength of an electrical
current, by a crooked line. For this purpose we must
draw a straight line to represent time, and make the distance
of each point of the crooked line above the straight
line a measure of the strength of the current at the corresponding
time. The size of the figure will then measure the
quantity of electricity that has passed, for the stronger the
current is the taller the figure will be, and the longer it lasts
the longer the figure will be; either cause makes both the
quantity of electricity and the size of the figure greater, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6441">6441</span>
in the same proportion, so the one is a measure of the other.
Now it is not an easy thing to measure the size of a figure;
the distance round it tells nothing; there is, however, a geometrical
method by which its size may be found. Draw
another line, with a great steepness where the figure is tall,
and with a less steepness where the height is less, and with
no steepness or horizontal where the figure has no height.
If this is done accurately, the height to which the new line
reaches will measure the size of the figure first drawn; for
the taller the figure is, the steeper the hill will be; the longer
the figure, the longer the hill; either cause makes both the
size of the figure and the height of the hill greater, and in
the same proportion; so the one is a measure of the other, and
so, moreover, is the height of the hill, which can be measured
by scale, a measure of the quantity of electricity that
has passed.</p>

<p>The first instrument that I made, which I have called a
"cart" integrator, is a machine which, if the lower figure is
traced out, will describe the upper. I will trace a circle; the
instrument follows the curious bracket shaped line that I
have already made sufficiently black to be seen at a distance.
The height of the new line measures the size of the circle;
the instrument has squared the circle. This machine is a
thing of mainly theoretical interest; my only object in showing
it is to explain the means by which I have developed a
practical and automatic instrument, of which I shall speak
presently. The guiding principle in the cart integrator is a
little three-wheeled cart, whose front wheel is controlled by
the machine. This, of course, is invisible at a distance, and
therefore I have here a large front wheel alone. On moving
this along the table, any twisting of its direction instantly
causes it to deviate from its straight path. Now suppose I
do not let it deviate, but compel it to go straight, then at once
a great strain is put upon the table; which is urged the
other way. If the table can move, it will instantly do so. A
table on rollers is inconvenient as an instrument, let us therefore
roll it round into a roller, then on moving the wheel
along it the roller will turn, and the amount by which it
turns will correspond to the height of the second figure
drawn by the cart integrator. If, therefore, the wheel is
inclined by a magnet under the influence of an electric current,
or by any other cause, the whole amount of which we
wish to know, then the number of turns of the rollers will
tell us this amount; or to go back to our water analogy, if
we had the weighted board to show current strength, and
had not the paddle wheel to show total quantity, we might
use the board to incline a disk in contact with a roller, and
then drag the rollers steadily along by clockwork. The
number of turns of the roller would give the quantity of
water. Instruments that will thus add up continuously indications
at a time, and so find amounts during a time, are
called integrators. The most important application that I
have made at present of the integrator described is what I
have called an engine-power meter. The instrument is on
the table, but as it is far too small to be seen at a distance, I
have arranged a large model to illustrate its action. The
object of this machine is to measure how much work an
engine has done during any time, and show the result on a
dial, so that a workman may read it off at once, without
having to make any calculations.</p>

<p>Before I can explain how work is measured, perhaps I
had better say a few words about the meaning of the word
"work." Work is done when pressure overcomes resistance,
producing motion. Neither motion nor pressure alone is
work. The two factors, pressure and motion, must occur
together. The work done is found by multiplying the pressure
by the distance moved. In an engine, steam pushes
the piston first one way then the other, overcomes resistance,
and does work. To find this we must multiply the pressure
by the motion at every instant, and add all the products together.
This is what the engine power-meter does, and it
shows the continuously growing result on a dial. When the
piston moves, it drags the cylinder along; where the steam
presses, the wheel is inclined. Neither action alone causes
the cylinder to turn, but when they occur together the cylinder
turns, and the number of turns registered on a dial
shows with mathematical accuracy how much work has
been done.</p>

<p>In the steam engine work is done in an alternating manner,
and it so happens that this alternating action exactly
suits the integrator. Suppose, however, that the action,
whatever it may be, which we wish to estimate is of a continuous
kind, such, for instance, as the continuous passage
of an electric current. Then, if by means of any device we
can suitably incline the wheel, so long as we keep pushing
the cylinder along so long will its rotation measure and indicate
the result; but there must come a time when the end
of the cylinder is reached. If then we drag it back again,
instead of going on adding up it will begin to take off from
the result, and the hands on the dial will go backward,
which is clearly wrong. So long as the current continues,
so long must the hands on the dial turn in one direction.
This effect is obtained in the instrument now on the table,
the electric energy meter, in this way. Clockwork causes
the cylinder to travel backward and forward by means of
what is called a mangle motion; but instead of moving
always in contact with each wheel, the cylinder goes forward
in contact with one and backward in contact with another
on its opposite side. In this instrument the inclination
of the wheels is effected by an arrangement of coils of wire,
the main current passing through two fixed concentric solenoids,
and a shunt current through a great length of fine
wire on a movable solenoid, hanging in the space between
the others. The movable portion has an equal number of
turns in opposite directions, and is therefore unaffected by
magnets held near it. The effect of this arrangement is
that the energy of the current&mdash;that is, the quantity multiplied
by the force driving it, or the electrical equivalent of
mechanical power&mdash;is measured by the slope of the wheels,
and the amount of work done by the current during any
time, by the number of turns of the cylinder, which is registered
on a dial. Professors Ayrton and Perry have devised
an instrument which is intended to show the same thing.
They make use of a clock and cause it to go too fast or too
slow by the action of the main on the shunt current; the
amount of wrongness of the clock, and not the time shown,
is said to measure the work done by the current. This
method of measuring the electricity by the work it has
done is one which has been proposed to enable the electrical
companies to make out their bills.</p>

<p>The other method is to measure the amount of electricity
that has passed without regard to the work done. There
are three lines on which inventors have worked for this purpose.
The first, which has been used in every laboratory ever
since electricity has been understood, is the chemical method.
When electricity passes through a salt solution it carries
metal with it, and deposits it on the plate by which the
electricity leaves the liquid. The amount of metal deposited
is a measure of the quantity of electricity. Mr. Sprague
and Mr. Edison have adopted this method; but as it is impossible
to allow the whole of a strong current to pass
through a liquid, the current is divided; a small proportion
only is allowed to pass through. Provided that the proportion
does not vary, and that the metal never has any
motions on its own account, the increase in the weight of
one of the metal plates measures the quantity of electricity.</p>

<p>The next method depends on the use of some sort of
integrating machine, and this being the most obvious method
has been attempted by a large number of inventors. Any
machine of this kind is sure to go, and is sure to indicate
something, which will be more nearly a measure of electricity
as the skill of the inventor is greater.</p>

<p>Meters for electricity of the third class are dynamical in their
action, and I believe that what I have called the vibrating
meter was the first of its class. It is well known that a
current passing round iron makes it magnetic. The force
which such a magnet exerts is greater when the current is
greater, but it is not simply proportional. If the current is
twice or three times as strong, the force is four times or
nine times as great, or, generally, the force is proportional to
the square of the current. Again, when a body vibrates
under the influence of a controlling force, as a pendulum
under the influence of gravity, four times as much force is
necessary to make it vibrate twice as fast, and nine times to
make it vibrate three times as fast; or, generally, the square
of the number measures the force. I will illustrate this by
a model. Here are two sticks nicely balanced on points, and
drawn into a middle position by pieces of tape, to which
weights may be hung. They are identical in every respect.
I will now hang a 1 lb. weight to each tape, and let the
pieces of wood swing. They keep time together absolutely.
I will now put 2 lb. on one tape. It is clear that the corresponding
stick is going faster, but certainly not twice as
fast. I will now hang on 4 lb. One stick is going at
exactly twice the pace of the other. To make one go three
times as fast it is obviously useless to put on 3 lb., for it
takes four to make it go twice as fast. I will hang on 9 lb.
One now goes exactly three times as fast as the other. I
will now put 4 lb. on the first, and leave the 9 lb. on the
second; the first goes twice while the second goes three
times. If instead of a weight we use electro-magnetic force
to control the vibrations of a body, then twice the current
produces four times the force, four times the force produces
twice the rate; three times the current produces nine times
the force, nine times the force produces three times the rate,
and so on; or the rate is directly proportional to the current
strength. There is on the table a working meter made on
this principle. I allow the current that passes through to
pass also through a galvanometer of special construction,
so that you can tell by the position of a spot of light on a
scale the strength of the current. At the present time there
is no current; the light is on the zero of the scale; the
meter is at rest. I now allow a current to pass from a
battery of the new Faure-Sellon-Volckmar cells which the
Storage Company have kindly lent me for this occasion.
The light moves through one division on the scale, and the
meter has started. I will ask you to observe its rate of
vibration. I will now double the current. This is indicated
by the light moving to the end of the second division on the
scale; the meter vibrates twice as fast. Now the current is
three times as strong, now four times, and so on. You
will observe that the position of the spot of light and the
rate of vibration always correspond. Every vibration of the
meter corresponds to a definite quantity of electricity, and
causes a hand on a dial to move on one step. By looking
at the dial, we can see how many vibrations there have been
and therefore how much electricity has passed. Just as the
vibrating sticks in the model in time to come rest, so the
vibrating part of the meter would in time do the same, if it
were not kept going by an impulse automatically given to it
when required. Also, just as the vibrating sticks can be
timed to one another by sliding weights along them, so the
vibrating electric meters can be regulated to one another so
that all shall indicate the same value for the same current,
by changing the position or weight of the bobs attached to
the vibrating arm. The other meter of this class, Dr. Hopkinson's,
depends on the fact that centrifugal force is proportional
to the square of the angular velocity. He therefore
allows a little motor to drive a shaft faster and faster,
until centrifugal force overcomes electro-magnetic attraction,
when the action of the motor ceases. The number of
turns of the motor is a measure of the quantity of electricity
that has passed.</p>

</div>

<p>I will now pass on to the measurement of power transmitted
by belting. The transmission of power by a strap is
familiar to every one in a treadle sewing machine or an
ordinary lathe. The driving force depends on the difference
in the tightness of the two sides of the belt, and the power
transmitted is equal to this difference multiplied by the
speed; a power meter must, therefore, solve this problem&mdash;it
must subtract the tightness of one side from the tightness
of the other side, multiply the difference by the speed at
every instant, and add all the products together, continuously
representing the growing amount on a dial. I shall
now show for the first time an instrument that I have devised,
that will do all this in the simplest possible manner. I have
here two wheels connected by a driving band of India-rubber,
round which I have tied every few inches a piece of white
silk ribbon. I shall turn one a little way, and hold the
other. The driving force is indicated by a difference of
stretching; the pieces of silk are much further apart on the
tight side than they are on the loose. I shall now turn the
handle, and cause the wheels to revolve; the motion of the
band is visible to all. The India-rubber is traveling faster
on the tight side than on the loose side, nearly twice as fast;
this must be so, for as there is less material on the tight side
than on the loose, there would be a gradual accumulation
of the India-rubber round the driven pulley, if they traveled
at the same speed; since there is no accumulation, the
tight side must travel the fastest. Now it may be shown
mathematically that the difference in the speeds is proportional
both to the actual speed and to the driving strain; it is,
therefore, a measure of the power or work being transmitted,
and the difference in the distance traveled is a measure of
the work done. I have here a working machine which
shows directly on a dial the amount of work done; this I
will show in action directly. Instead of India-rubber,
elastic steel is used. Since the driving pulley has the
velocity of the tight side, and the driven of the loose side of
the belt, the difference in the number of their turns, if they
are of equal size, will measure the work. This difference I
measure by differential gearing which actuates a hand on a
dial. I may turn the handle as fast as I please; the index
does not move, for no work is being done. I may hold the
wheel, and produce a great driving strain; again the index
remains at rest, for no work is being done. I now turn the
handle quickly, and lightly touch the driven wheel with my
finger. The resistance, small though it is, has to be overcome;
a minute amount of work is being done; the index
creeps round gently. I will now put more pressure on my
finger, more work is being done, the index is moving faster;
whether I increase the speed or the resistance, the index
turns faster; its rate of motion measures the power, and
the distance it has moved, or the number of turns, measures
the work done. That this is so I will show by experiment.
I will wind up in front of a scale a 7 lb. weight; the hand
has turned one-third round. I will now wind a 28 lb weight
up the same height; the hand has turned four-thirds of a
turn. There are other points of a practical nature with
regard to this invention which I cannot now describe.</p>

</div>

<p>There is one other class of instruments which I have developed
of which time will let me say very little. The
object of this class of instruments is to divide the speed with
which two registrations are being effected, and continuously
record the quotient. In the instrument on the table two
iron cones are caused to rotate in time with the registrations;
a magnetized steel reel hangs on below. This reel turns about,
and runs up or down the cones until it finds a place at
which it can roll at ease. Its position at once indicates the
ratio of the speeds, which will be efficiency, horse-power per
hour or one thing in terms of another. Just as the integrators
are derived from the steering of the ordinary bicycle,
so this instrument is derived from the double steering of the
"Otto" bicycle. Though I am afraid that I have not succeeded
in the short time at my disposal in making clear
all the points on which I have touched, yet I hope that I
have done something to remove the very prevalent opinion
that meters for power and electricity do not exist.

<h2>RAISING AND MOVING MASONRY BUILDINGS.</h2>

<p>The first important application of the method of lifting
massive structures and moving them to another spot was
made two years ago at Boston, Mass., in the moving back
of a hotel that stood about fourteen feet on the line of a proposed
widening of Tremont Street. Since that time several
analogous cases have occurred in several cities of the United
States, so that, for this sort of work, a general method of
operating has been devised, notwithstanding the special difficulties
that present themselves according to the different
methods of construction and the surroundings.</p>

<p>All structures, before being moved, must first be separated
from their foundations and then raised. These operations
are certainly the most costly and those that take the longest
time. It is necessary to take minute precautions and to exercise
great watchfulness in order to succeed in planting
solidly on the ground the timber work that has to support
the pressure of the screws by means of which the entire
building is to be afterward raised. The success of the operation
depends absolutely upon the care and attention that are
bestowed upon these preliminary operations, since the least
negligence may lead to a disaster.</p>

</div>

<h3>RAISING AND MOVING MASONRY BUILDINGS.</h3>
</div>

<p>The accompanying figures show the method employed in
moving several buildings of different construction, and the
peculiar arrangements that have been made, according to
circumstances.</p>

<p>The instrument most commonly employed in the execution
of such work consists of the following parts: (1) of a
cast iron screw having a pitch of 0.56 inch; (2) of a nut provided
with a shoulder and two projections that serve to fix
it; and (3) of a cast iron plate that is interposed between the
head of the screw and the beam upon which the latter is to
exert its pressure. Moreover, each nut is set into an oak
block, 4 inches in thickness, which rests upon the upper
beams of the timber work that is designed to sustain the
structure.</p>

<p>All the pieces of wood of the timber work, properly so
called, are of spruce, and measure 6x6 inches. Those that
are in a direction perpendicular to the foundation walls are
3 feet in length while the longitudinal ones must be long
enough to support several screws in order to annul the effect
of joints.</p>

<p>Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent a house at Buffalo belonging to
the New York and Lackawanna Railroad Company, constructed
of bricks and having a frontage of 90 feet. Between
the openings in the latter there are pillars of dressed stone
and cast iron columns. The building is four stories high,
and the outer walls are 1 foot in thickness.</p>

<p>During the month of June, 1882, this structure was raised
all in one piece and moved back 35 feet, in order to give
greater width to the railway. This work was performed in
so regular a manner that no interruption occurred in the
business of the Company's offices.</p>

<p>The first operation consisted in running well squared
spruce beams, 12 in. × 8 ft., through the walls and under
the ground floor. These beams projected beyond the wall
on each side and were spaced about 3¼ feet apart, and care
was taken to have them in the same horizontal plane. After
ramming down the earth upon which the timber work, f,
was to rest, the first transverse beams forming the foundation
platform were laid in place in such a way as to have
between them the same spacing as between the cross-pieces,
<i>a</i>, and so as to be exactly on the same level. These were
afterward surmounted with longitudinal beams with alternate
transverse ones until the desired height was reached.
This framework having once been put in place, there were
placed in the axis of each piece of timber work string-pieces,
<i>b</i>, which ran without a break the entire length of the wall.
Jack-screws, <i>v</i>, of the kind above described, were finally
arranged in pairs under each of the cross-pieces, <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>On the front side (Fig. 3) particular precautions were
taken to support the stone pillars and iron columns. To
this end, apertures were made in the foundation, starting
from the axis of the pillars and terminating at the axis of
the neighboring columns. Spruce sills were put into these
openings and others between the columns, the last-named
ones having been put in place after the masonry had been
completely severed. The cross-pieces, <i>a</i>, were thus under
the sills, <i>g</i>, before the putting in place of the screws, <i>v</i>, and
these latter were maneuvered in such a way as to merely
support the structure without lifting any of its parts.</p>

<p>These preliminaries having been finished, all the pieces of
the timber work were examined with the greatest care,
while, at the same time, the joints were consolidated and
the defects in leveling were rectified by means of spruce
wedges.</p>

<p>During the time of lifting, the workmen were arranged
in pairs opposite each other, and on each side of the wall,
where each one had 12 to 14 screws to maneuver. In order
to render the motion very uniform, the superintendent of the
work gave signals by means of a whistle. At this moment
each man gave the screw a half revolution, passed to the
following one, and continued thus until all the screws under
his supervision had been revolved to the same degree. At
a fresh signal this operation was begun again, and so on.</p>

<p>When the building had been lifted to a height of twelve
inches, it became necessary to raise the screws. To effect
this, two rows of beams (Fig. 7) were added to the timber-work,
and each screw was moved in succession, so as to
always leave one in position. By these means the building
was gradually lifted to the desired height, and it now became
necessary to take the requisite measures for moving
it back. With this object in view, spruce floor timbers, <i>e</i>,
very smooth and well lubricated with tallow and soap, were
laid upon the timber work and afterward covered with oak
planks, <i>d</i>, one inch in thickness, and upon these latter were
placed joists, <i>c</i>, that supported string-pieces, <i>b</i>, that were
firmly fixed to the joists by means of spruce pins driven in
with force. As the floor timbers that were employed had
to be as long as possible, they were united end to end by a
strong joint and prolonged as far as the new spot upon
which the edifice was to rest. Throughout their whole extent
they were supported by sleepers that were fixed firmly
in the earth. The entire weight of the structure being
carried by the pieces, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>f</i>, after the removal
of the screws, the jacks, V, were then placed in position,
their heads resting against the string-pieces, <i>b</i>, at the points
marked S, and their other extremities being received by a
framework set into the earth. It took but twelve jacks to
move the entire mass, and these were maneuvered under
the orders of a superintendent, who transmitted his signals
with a whistle.</p>

<p>It took forty days to perform all these operations, and it
required fifty men to lift the structure. After the jacks, V,
had been put in place, the building was moved in three
days, or at the rate of 11.68 feet per day. This is a medium
rate of speed to be adopted in the moving of a structure
like this, for, under very favorable conditions, it might be
carried to over eighteen feet per day.</p>

<p>The timber work which was used in lifting the building
was afterward put together again, in the same manner,
around prolonged foundations, and the same were put in
place a second time after the manner described above.
After the floor timbers, e, had been removed by slightly
lifting the load, and the structure had been lowered to its
proper position, the intervals between the cross-pieces, <i>a</i>,
and the walls of the new foundations were filled in with
masonry; the mass was then allowed to settle gently down
into its place and the cross-pieces were removed.</p>

<p>When buildings stand very near each other, timber-work
cannot be put together outside of the walls, and it therefore
becomes necessary to adopt the arrangement shown in Fig.
9, all the work being done here beneath the structure. The
cross-pieces, <i>a</i>, occupy here the entire width of the house,
and are spaced about 36 inches apart from axis to axis. The
structure rests upon two pieces of timber work constructed
like the ones mentioned above. Besides this, it is necessary
to utilize the timbers, L, of the flooring, P, for supporting
a part of the load.</p>

<p>During the widening of State Street, in Chicago, several
three or four story brick structures were moved in this
way. One of these houses was set back about four feet
without the necessity of lifting it. Apertures (Fig. 10) four
feet in length were cut in the foundation walls, the edges
were made level, and planks, <i>c</i> and <i>c'</i>, were inserted and
fixed in tightly by wedges. The intervening masonry was
removed, and, after laying planks alongside of those already
in place, the structure was put in motion in the ordinary
way.</p>

<p>When single threaded screws are employed for moving
buildings, it requires much time and manual labor to place
and move the pieces. For the purpose of securing greater
rapidity in these operations, Mr. Hollingsworth has devised
a sort of jack-screw (Fig. 11) that consists of a steel screw
about eight feet in length and three inches in diameter, provided
with two threads, running in opposite directions. The
nuts are set into the corresponding extremities of two
beams, one of which abuts against a cast iron brace-block,
<i>n</i>, held in place by a stirrup-iron, <i>t</i>, while the other bears
against the string-pieces, <i>b</i>. Thanks to this arrangement,
a structure may be moved at one time over a length of
6 feet instead of 1.3, the latter being the maximum travel
with single screws.</p>

<p>The method in which slide beams, f, are prolonged in
view of resisting the pressure of the jacks is scarcely employed
at present, the objection to it being that it occasions
changes of direction from the line formed by the timber
work. For this reason, contractors prefer to use independent
posts to receive the jacks.&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr">Revue Industrielle</i>.</p>

<h2 id="FILTER_FOR_INDUSTRIAL_WORKS">FILTER FOR INDUSTRIAL WORKS.</h2>

<p>As a rule, bleach and dye works are established where
there is a sufficiency of good and soft water, except in such
cases where for special reasons it is desirable to use town
water, and which then is generally clear. Where, however,
water from brooks, rivers, or lodges is used, as is mostly
the case, it is often discolored after heavy showers by earthy
substances which are carried away by it. These impurities,
all existing in the water in suspension, are not at all desirable
for the dyer, and less for the bleacher, who generally
allows the water to settle in a lodge, to give it time to deposit
its impurities by gravitation. We understand that by
means such as these even the water of the much-abused
Irwell is made, in a Salford bleach-works, to produce some
of the most beautiful whites possible. These lodges occupy,
however, much space, which is not always available, and
filtration is therefore the best where it can be carried out.
We here produce the description of a cheap and efficient
filter which bleachers or dyers may easily make for themselves.
The dimensions are of course dependent upon the
quantity of water to be filtered, and as a guide we shall describe
a filter serving for a volume of water of about 1½
cubic yards per minute. In the first instance a hole is dug
at a point where the water has sufficient fall to give it a
head, and here a cistern set in cement is bricked out, measuring
about 30 yards in length, 2½ yards in width, and 2½
yards in height. Across this cistern two partition walls
are erected, one at the left resting upon rails, and the other
going down to the bottom of the cistern. Between these two
walls railway rails are laid crosswise, and over these a floor
of wooden laths. Over this floor the filtering media are
placed, consisting of a bottom layer of stones, then a layer
of coke, then a layer of gravel, and lastly of a top layer of
river sand. The water enters on the left-hand side into the
space between the outer wall and the partition, and descends
under the floor of the filter, through which it rises and
passes in succession through the four layers of filtering substance
until it issues at the top, when it runs over the partition,
and out by the pipe shown in the right hand corner.
It will be seen that the course of the water is upward
through the filter, and in this respect contrary to the usual
custom. The filter is cleaned about once a month by reversing
the course of the water, and turning it indirectly on
the top of the filter&mdash;causing it to run but at the bottom&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6444">6444</span>
thus carrying all deposits with it. Both the central
filtering compartments, as also the overflow cistern at the
right hand, contain, near the bottom, doors, through which,
when opened, the cleansing water runs off by a separate
channel to the river. The dimensions of the cistern can, of
course, be made to suit the situation.&mdash;<cite>Tex. Manfr.</cite></p>

<h2 id="THE_VAL_ST_LAMBERT_GLASS_WORKS">THE VAL ST. LAMBERT GLASS WORKS.</h2>

<p>During the recent meeting in Belgium of the Institution
of Mechanical Engineers several interesting excursions were
made, and by no means the least interesting was the visit to
the glass works of Val St. Lambert.</p>

<p>This is one of the largest glass works in existence, entirely
devoted to the production of domestic articles, such as
tumblers, wine glasses, lamp chimneys, and such like. A
good deal of ornamental work is also turned out, a staff of
highly competent artists being employed in painting glass
vases, etc., such as are used for the decoration of rooms.</p>

<p>The Val St. Lambert works stand on the right bank of the
Meuse, in the commune of Seraing, and about seven and a
half miles from Liege. As the head offices of Cockerill's
vast establishment are located in the old palace of the Bishops
of Liege, so the Cristalleries of Val St. Lambert occupy
the site of the Abbey de Rosieres. Up to the year 1192 the
site was almost a desert, but about that period the abbey
was founded. In 1202 Hughes de Pierrepont, Bishop of
Liege, gave to the monks a tract of land and woods situated
in what was then called the Champ des Maures, whereon
was built the abbey. It prospered and became powerful.
At the end of the last century it was reconstructed, and at
that time were raised the fine buildings now used as a manufactory.
The rebuilding had hardly been finished when the
Revolution came, and with it the expulsion of the monks.
It was sold by the nation, and was used for various manufacturing
purposes, until the year 1825, when it was purchased
by MM. Kemlin and Lelievre. There had previously
existed, at Vonêche, near Givet, a glass works carried on by
M. D'Artigues, its owner, aided by M. Kemlin, his nephew,
and M. Aug. Lelievre. This latter gentleman had left the
Ecole Polytechnique of Paris with distinction, and was the
son of Mr. Anselme de Lelievre, Inspector-General of
Mines, and a distinguished savant of the last century. MM.
Kemlin and Lelievre both became naturalized Frenchmen.
However, the frontier traced by the Congress of Vienna for
the new territory of Belgium cut Vonêche off from France.
The glass works accordingly lost their only market, cut off
from it by a heavy tariff. M. D'Artigues left the place and
went to France, while MM. Kemlin and Lelievre found in
the old Val St. Lambert Abbey what they wanted in Belgium,
and this was the origin of the glass works. Nor would
it be easy to hit on a better site. In the heart of a rich country,
on the borders of a fine river, in the center of a coal
basin, and close to the Marihaye Collieries, well provided
with railway accommodation, the Val St. Lambert glass
works possess every advantage, and they have been proportionately
successful.</p>

<p>The establishment is worked by a company known as the
Societé Anonyme des Cristalleries du Val St. Lambert, under
the Presidency of M. Jules Deprez; and the company possess
four distinct establishments, namely, that at Val St.
Lambert; one at D'Herbatte, near Namur, founded in 1851;
a third in the Rue Barre-Neuvill, at Namur, founded in
1753; and, lastly, one at Jambes, near the same town,
founded in 1850.</p>

<p>We need not trace at length, says <i>The Engineer</i>, the history
of the works. It will be enough to say that for a long
time they were carried on with small or no profits; but a
great advance was made when, in 1830, coal was first substituted
for wood for heating purposes. Further capital
was introduced in 1836, and operations have been carried
on practically without intermission ever since. In 1850 the
annual turn-over was about £60,000. In 1880 the turn-over
of the company was £200,000. To give an idea of the magnitude
of the operations carried on, we may say that no
fewer than 120,000 pieces are turned out <i>every day</i>. To
pack this there are used 50,000 kilos. of heather, 55,000
kilos. of straw, and 250,000 feet of boards per month. The
sand of all kinds used per year weighs 7,000,000 kilogs., and
the weight of the fire clay 1,500,000 kilogs. The weight of
the finished goods sent out per year exceeds 9,000,000 kilogs.
The company employs in all about 3,000 hands, 1,800 of
whom are at Val St. Lambert. Much attention is paid to
the welfare of the operatives by the company, and a species
of co-operative store is worked with great success. Many
of the hands have been on the works of the company for fifty
years, and the managers speak in the highest terms of their
servants. They know nothing of "St. Monday." They
are laborious, assiduous, intelligent, and attached to the
works and the locality, which they rarely quit. These conditions
are the most favorable possible for the employers,
and they are far too rare in Great Britain. The Val St.
Lambert hands, men, women, and children, work uninterruptedly
for eleven hours a day all the week through, and
some of the men even longer. This affords a remarkable
contrast with the hours of labor and customs of our English
glass workers.</p>

<p>We take it for granted that our readers know generally
how glass is made. That a mixture of sand and an alkali
is fused into a kind of pasty mass. The fusion is effected
in pots of refractory clay, of which the general form is
something like that shown in the sketch. The mouth of
the pot is shown at A. The pots at Val St. Lambert are of
various sizes; the largest hold about 16 cwt. of glass. The
duration of the pots is very variable; they last sometimes
only a few days, at others several weeks or even months,
much depending on the quality of the pot. The temperature
to which they are exposed is not excessively high.
The great thing to be effected in a glass melting furnace
is the perfectly equal distribution of the heat. At Val St.
Lambert gas is used, generated in Siemens or Boetius producers.
There are in all twenty furnaces. They are grouped
in threes or fours, in the large buildings, with high roofs.
Formerly the furnaces were square, and held each eight
melting pots, which did not hold more than 250 kilos. of
glass. The modern furnaces each receive from twelve to
fourteen melting pots. The modern melting pots as made
by the Battersea Plumbago Crucible Company do not seem
to be known here.</p>

<div class="figcenter w50">
<a href="images/p6444a.png">

</div>

<p>The peculiarities of the construction of the glass melting
furnaces at Val St. Lambert will be gathered from the
annexed sketch. The furnace is circular, 14 ft. or 15 ft. in
diameter, and from the roof, E, to the floor is about 5 ft.
6 in. high. In the center of the floor is a cylindrical opening,
A, through which rises the mixture of gas and air, the
latter being introduced through four openings, three of
which are shown. Two of the pots are indicated by dotted
lines at D D. The equitable diffusion of the heat is effected
in the following way: Inside the furnace are constructed as
many vertical flues as there are pots. Two of these are
shown at G G. They have small openings about 5 in. by
8 in. at the bottom. The course pursued by flame is indicated
by the bent arrows. The flame rising strikes the
crown, E, and is deflected downward and drawn off by the
side flues, which deliver into the second vaulted space, F.
In this, in some cases, are annealed the finished articles of
glass. In others is fixed a boiler, steam being generated by
the waste heat. In others there is no opening at the top of
F at H, but there is one at the side instead, through which
the flame is led to raise steam in Belleville tubulous boilers.
The steam is used to drive the engines in the grinderies.
Not much power is required, and it is very easily obtained
from the waste heat.</p>

<p>The operations of the glass blower have been too often
described to need redescription here. One or two points,
however, deserve notice. One is the large use made of
wooden moulds. In these are formed all kinds of circular
articles, such as tumblers and lamp glasses. The moulds
are in halves, and are kept soaked with water to prevent
them from burning. Inside they become lined with charcoal.
The glass blower, getting a knob of glass on the
end of his blowing rod, blows a very thick, small bulb;
this he then places on the mould, which is closed by a very
small boy; in but too many cases mere children, seven or
eight years old, are employed. The child holds the two
sides of the mould together while the blower rotates
the bulb within, blowing all the time. The work is turned
out very true. Up to a comparatively recent period
the tumbler was cut to the proper depth while hot with a
pair of scissors, but this has been abandoned, and an
extremely ingenious little machine is now used for cutting
lamp glasses, tumblers, etc. The article to be cut is placed
vertically on a stand. At the proper height above the
stand is fixed a sharp steel point, and by touching the
glass against this a very small scratch is made. At the
same level is fixed a little mouthpiece through which
issues, under pressure, a tiny gas flame, not thicker than a
sheet of note paper. This falls on the glass, which is
turned round by the woman attendant. The glass is
heated in an extremely narrow band all round. The touch
of a moistened finger suffices for the complete separation of
the two parts of the glass round the heated girdle. In
fact, this is a very elegant application to manufacturing
purposes of the well known hot wire method of cutting
glass so often tried with indifferent success by the enterprising
amateur.</p>

<p>Glass grinding is carried out on a very large scale at Val
St. Lambert in huge well lighted shops. There are four
grinderies at Val St. Lambert, and one at Herbatte, the
total number of which is 800, and the floor space occupied
is no less than 24,000 square feet. The first steam engine
was put down to grind glass in 1836. A great deal of
engraving is done with fluoric acid, the vessel to be
engraved being protected with wax in which the design is
etched. Tilghman's sand blast is also employed, as well as
the old copper disk system; flats are ground on tumblers by
automatic machinery.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to do more than give a general
idea of the operations carried on in this vast establishment,
every portion of which was thrown open to the members
of the Institution, while numbers of heads of departments
went round and answered every question, and explained
every detail with a frankness and a courtesy beyond praise.
It is impossible to inspect such an establishment as that at
Val St. Lambert without feeling how hard is the battle
which manufacturers in this country have to fight. There,
as we have said, are to be found every advantage of position,
and to this is added a body of workmen, active, sober,
industrious, among whom is heard no talk of strikes, and
who are content to work every day and all day long; such
men, directed by heads possessed of no small scientific
ability, and re-enforced by the command of ample capital,
cannot fail to make a mark in any market, and we only
speak the truth when we regret that we have not such
works and such men on English soil as there are to be found
at Val St. Lambert.</p>

<h2>MEASURING STARCH GRANULES.</h2>

<p>It is well known that the microscopist can readily distinguish
potato starch from all other starches by the size
of the grains. Saare has found that the size of the potato
starch granules increases with the quality of the starch. In
first quality starch they have an average diameter of 33
micro-millimeters, in second grade 21, in third grade
17, in the rinsing water 12, and in that floated off on the
water only 8 micro-millimeters. Saare's paper may be found
in full in the <i xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift fur Spiritusindustrie</i>, vi., 482.</p>

<h2 id="PROPER_SHOEING">PROPER SHOEING.</h2>

<p>In his article on horseshoeing Mons. Lavalard makes some
good points, and also some that appear to me to be erroneous.
He says, in regard to the frog, "It is evident,
then, that the frog helps the hold, but strange to say, it
alone of the three parts has a share in the hold when the
hoof is shod."</p>

<p>We see nothing strange about this where horses travel
over hard roads; the case is otherwise on soft roads or race
tracks. It is easy to make the ground surface of such shape
that it will have sufficient hold, without the action of the
frog. In the shod foot, the frog has more to do with keeping
the foot healthy than assisting in the hold. With horses
used for speeding purposes, the frog helps to sustain the
sole of the foot, as when the foot is brought down with
great force and the road soft enough to receive the imprint
of the shoe. He further says that: "Simultaneous with
this preservation and regeneration of the frog, the hold of
the horse becomes firmer, and more equally divided toward
the heels, and when starting a load, there is no clamping
with the toe of the hoof, but the foot is brought down
flat."</p>

<p>Let us examine this statement and see if the reason why
the horse brings the foot down flat is because the frog is
good, and has a good hold on the ground. The reason appears
to <i>us</i> to be because from the manner of shoeing the
horse cannot put his foot in any other way. The shoes are
much thinner behind than in front, and the heels pared
low enough to insure the frogs resting on the ground. Excessive
paring of the heels gives extra length to the shoe,
which, being thick at the toe, props the toe up in such a
manner that the horse is <i>forced</i> to let the foot remain flat
when starting a load. Nothing is gained by keeping the
foot flat while starting a load, and to prove this, we ask
the reader to observe unshod horses when starting a load.
The frog having free access to the ground, see if the horse
does not clamp the ground with the toe when exhibiting
the maximum of strength. Also examine the imprint of
horses' feet (especially the hind ones) when drawing heavy
loads over soft ground, and see if the shoe is not pressed
more firmly into the ground at the toe than at the heel.
This is not because he gets a better use of the frog by so
doing, but because the foot is in a better position for the
horse to exert his strength without injury to the back
tendons. As a further test, place yourself on an incline
facing squarely up hill, and see how much power you can
exert; then place your feet exactly opposite in direction,
and note how much power you can then exhibit. What
has made the difference? Simply the relative position of
the heels and toes. We do not, like Mons. Lavalard, wish
to force our horses to travel up hill all the time, which is
the case when shod as he describes.</p>

<p>Horseshoers, like other men who follow a special calling,
are apt to think that their theories and practices relating to
their special trade are superior to those of other men. I
think it is safe to make the assertion, without fear of successful
refutation, that there is not more than one horseshoer
in ten thousand but what can convince the average
horse owner that he (the smith) knows just about all that
is worth knowing about horseshoeing.</p>

<p>And the same average horse owner is conceited enough
to think himself a better judge of a good job of shoeing
than the intelligent animal that wears the shoes till his
feet feel as though they were full of thistles. A horse's
foot is not a thing that can be cut and slashed into all
shapes with impunity, but requires careful as well as intelligent
treatment. It is a great mistake to suppose that
every sound foot should be treated alike. Each foot has
its individuality, which must be <i>recognized</i> and <i>respected</i>
if good results are to follow shoeing. It is a lamentable
fact, and one that cannot be disputed, that most horseshoers
have but a faint notion of what is required to shoe
a horse properly, even where no defects exist. If he gets
pay for the work, he gives himself no trouble to improve
on his methods. But with the owner the case is different.
The usefulness and value of the horse are largely affected
by the condition of the feet, and he must learn to know
how his horse ought to be shod, and then see to it that
the work is properly executed. We know from personal
experience that this is hard to do. The smith must understand
that you are in earnest about the matter, and that
you are bound to have your orders obeyed. I have found
some men very obstinate, and others always ready to do
anything that was an improvement on the old way. First
decide what kind of labor the horse is expected to perform.
If he is expected to go fast, great care and skill will
be required to get everything just as it should be,
and don't blame the smith for charging extra for extra
work.</p>

<p>It will often be necessary to make several trials before you
find out just what suits the horse best, and don't fail to
let the horse be judge in the matter, for when he is suited
you ought to be.</p>

<p>Place the horse on a smooth, clean floor, and note the
set of each foot, and whether it is in line with the limb
above it. Cut away the wall of the foot until you come
to where it joins the sole; except at the heels and quarter,
it may not be quite as low; let the frog and bars remain
intact, but see that the shoe will not bear much on the
bars. Give the sole about its natural concavity of surface
up to the wall, but no further. Place the foot on the floor
and see if it is in line with the limb; if not, remove enough
horn to make it so. The slant of the front part of the
fore foot should, as a rule, be the same as that of the pastern;
that of the hind ones a little steeper. Now stand
behind the horse while he is made to walk, and see if when
the foot approaches the floor both sides come down at the
same time so that there is no rocking motion from one
side striking first. Disregard the advice of some writers
who recommend to have the sole bare on the iron; that
theory when put into practice doesn't work worth a
cent.</p>

<p>In most cases it will not be necessary to remove much,
if any, of the horn from the sole, but there are cases
where it will be found necessary to remove quite an
amount, or the sole will become so inelastic that it will
greatly interfere with the action of the internal organs of
the foot. It is evident that nature made the sole of the
foot so that it might be acted upon mechanically to remove
its surplus growth in the same way as the wall, for
in the unshod foot it receives the impact of all sorts of substances,
from soft mud to sharp, flinty rocks; and that, too,
without becoming dry and brittle.</p>

<p>The bearing surface should be half an inch wide and
made <i>positively flat and level</i>, being without lumps or depressions,
and not beveled either way unless they are hard
and inclined to pinch, when it should be beveled to the
outside, so that the weight of the horse when brought upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6445">6445</span>
its surface will cause the heels to open, thereby causing a
more healthy condition of the frog. The nail holes of the
shoe should be further from the outer edge of the shoe,
especially at the toe, than those usually seen in the market.
The bearing surfaces of the foot and shoe should be as
nearly approximated as possible, else the hoof will be
bruised and the shoe soon loosened. The holes being further
from the edge, allows the nails to take a deeper and lower
hold than is usually given them; the direction of the nails
is more nearly across the grain or layers of horn, causing
less splitting of its substance, thereby securing a firmer
hold upon the foot. Two large nails are usually chosen,
5s or 6s being large enough for ordinary shoes. It is not
necessary to hammer down the clinches, if care has been
taken to draw the nails, finishing with light strokes of the
hammer. The shoes will stay just as long, as we can testify
by four years' experience, and the advantages are that the
horn is not injured by filing below the clinches nor by the
strokes of the hammer during the operation.</p>

<p>Should the horse step upon the shoe, no horn will
be removed with the shoe, as is usually done when the
clinches are left long and then turned down with the
hammer. In such cases, the shoe will be torn off, no matter
how solid the clinches hold, and it is better to come away
without breaking the hoof. We repeat and make emphatic
that the bearing surface of the shoe <i>must not be concave</i>, as it
is almost sure to make corns, and induce an inflammatory
condition of the foot, and this inflammatory action is the
forerunner of the long list of evils that are sure to follow,
unless means are taken to relieve the parts. And yet almost
every horseshoer in the country gives the bearing surface of
the shoe a bevel to the center. Many smiths will deny this,
but after they have the shoe ready to apply to the foot, take
a square and place the edge across the bearing surface at
the heel of the shoe, and ninety-nine times out of one hundred
the outside will be the highest.</p>

<p>The front action of a horse may be greatly modified by
the weight of the shoe, and here is where great caution,
close attention, and a thorough knowledge of the principles
involved are required, or one will be liable to throw his
horse out of balance if he is used for speeding; for slow
work it is better to have the shoe somewhat lighter than
the horse might carry than to err in the opposite direction.
It is not intended by me to take up all the points of horseshoeing
that might be dwelt upon with profit, and no one
who reads these remarks will be more ready than I to learn
a better method of shoeing than that I now practice,
and I sincerely hope that some reader of this paper will
favor us with more information on this important subject.&mdash;P. D. B.,

<p>There is yet a good deal to do in successfully applying
the roller process to small mills of from 25 to 100 barrels
capacity. There has been a great deal done, no doubt, but
one thing is lost sight of in all the patents that have been
granted so far, and that is cheapness, not only in the price
of the machine, but also in its application to the existing or
original plant in the mill. It should be of such a nature
that as few changes in the machinery as possible should be
made.</p>

<p>If a grain of wheat is examined, it will be astonishing to
see the chemical laboratory that is locked up in it. The
most valuable substances, gluten, is placed near the air and
light, while the little cells of the interior are composed
of starch, which being the softest is the first to break up
under the influence of the rolls. Hence, the flour of the
first and second breaks is mostly composed of that substance.</p>

<p>About three and a half per cent. of woody fiber can be
removed from a kernel of wheat by a moistened cloth; it is
of no value, whatever. The next coating holds nearly all
the iron, potash, soda, lime, and phosphoric acid. This
wrapper is the granary, so to speak, in which is deposited all
the wealth of the berry, and like a good safe is the hardest to
open, by either the rollers or burrs.</p>

<p>The use of rolls in cleaning bran is now generally recognized,
and they have proved very useful and practical for
this purpose especially in large mills. Bran, however, can
only be thoroughly cleaned by several operations, and the
previous condition of the bran has a great deal to do with
the number of operations it has to undergo on the rolls to be
well cleaned.</p>

<p>Each passage through the rolls changes the condition
of bran, and the oftener it goes through them the lighter
and cleaner it becomes, until all the floury portion is removed.</p>

<p>The Austrians use corrugated rolls for the purpose of
cleaning bran, the finest being on the last, as in the break
rolls. It is more scientific and philosophical to clean the
bran in this way than to rub off the flour between burrs
in this way than to rub off some of the branny portion as
well as the glutinous part.</p>

<p>Rollers for the first cleaning are from eight to ten inches
in diameter and from three to five hundred corrugations are
used, and this increases up to one thousand for the last rolls
used; but fine corrugations wear out soon, and the rolls have
to be frequently corrugated or the bran has to be finished
on burrs.</p>

<p>The use of rollers is preferable to that of stones for bran,
and their use is considered an important advance in milling
by most German experts.</p>

<p>As the advantage of the use of rolls instead of burrs consists
in the production of a greater amount of middlings,
this advantage should be experienced in the cleaning of bran.
As the small starchy particles adhering to the bran are
separated in the shape of middlings instead of flour, a better
quantity of flour is produced from these middlings both in
color and strength than that which is made from the stones'
product.</p>

<p>Differential speed in rolls is not only better in making
middlings, but in grinding bran as well. This has been
proved by several experiments.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that there is less care bestowed on
the hanging and care of shafting than upon any other means
used in applying power to manufacturing purposes. If the
steam engine or the water wheel is in good order, and performing
their work properly, and the machines driven by
them are also in good order, there is seldom a thought
bestowed upon the media between the actuating power and
its ultimate development, except the necessary attention
which must be paid to the belting, and oiling of the machinery.</p>

<p>Often, when the result of the power is not satisfactory, it is
not the driving power that is at fault, but the result may be
found in the shafting, or other intermediate transferers of the
power. Generally, in such a case, the belts are examined and
their condition assumed for the imperfect transmission of
the power from the prime mover.</p>

<p>The condition of the belts is a very important point in
all manufacturing, but more particularly in mills where a
steadiness of motion is a desideratum, and attention to them
will save many dollars in the course of a year; but there are
other as important elements which are not always taken into
consideration, and the principal one is the condition of the
shafting. A line of shafting running perfectly true, without
jumping or jerking, turning smoothly and noiselessly,
is a delight to the mechanical eye; and the first thing always
examined by a thorough millwright when he enters a mill,
is the shafting.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is nothing will strike a person who has been
out of the milling business for some time so much as the
change in the system of bolting. This is caused by the
numerous separations, and it is in this the whole secret of
gradual reduction lies.</p>

<h2 id="PHOTOGRAPHS_FOR_STUDYING_THE_MOVEMENTS_OF_MEN_AND_ANIMALS">PHOTOGRAPHS FOR STUDYING THE MOVEMENTS OF MEN AND ANIMALS.<br />

By <span class="smcap">M. Marey</span>.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></h2>

<p>When a series of photographs representing the successive
attitudes of an animal is taken on the same plate, it is
naturally desirable to multiply these images, for the purpose
of getting the greatest possible number of phases
of the movement. But when the animals to be reproduced
do not move rapidly, the number of images is limited by
their superposition and the resulting confusion. Thus, a
man running at a moderate pace may be photographed
ten times in a second, without the impressions on the
plate being confused. If, at times, one leg is depicted on
a part already bearing the trace of another leg, the superposition
does not alter the image; the whites become only
more intense in those portions of the plates receiving an impression
twice over, but the contours of both limbs are still
to be distinguished. In the case, however, of a man walking
slowly, these superpositions are so numerous as to render the
reproduction very confused.</p>

<p>It is to remedy this defect that I have had recourse to partial
photography; that is to say, I have suppressed certain
parts of the image, that the rest may be more easily understood.</p>

<p>In the method which I employ, only white and light objects
affect the sensitive plate; it suffices, therefore, to clothe
that portion of the body to be suppressed in black. If a man
dressed in a parti-colored costume of black and white walk
over the track, by turning the white parts of his apparel
toward the camera&mdash;the right side, for instance&mdash;he will be
reproduced as if he only possessed the right half of his body.
These images permit the various successive phases of movement
to be accurately followed, the rotation of the foot and
leg when both on the ground and lifted up, and the oscillation
of the limb at the hip joint while moving along in a continuous
manner.</p>

<p>These partial photographs are also useful in the analysis
of rapid movements, because they allow of the number of
attitudes represented being multiplied. At the same time,
as a man's leg is rather large, its reproduction cannot be
multiplied very often, owing to confusion by superposition.
I have therefore sought to diminish the size of the images,
so as to an admit of repetition at very short intervals. The
method consists in attiring a walker in a black costume having
narrow bands of bright metal applied down the length of
the leg, thigh, and arm, following exactly the direction of
the bones of the limbs. This plan permits the number of
images formerly produced to be increased at least tenfold;
thus, instead of ten photographs per second, one hundred
may be taken. To do this it is not necessary to change
the speed of rotation of the disk, but instead of piercing it
with one aperture, ten holes are made equally disposed around
the circumference.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<div class="figcenter w50" id="pfstme">

</div>

<p>The figure here shown is from one of the negatives projected
on the screen from the lantern. The dotted lines have been
filled in to form direct lines. The figure shows the successive
phases of one step in running. Only the left leg is represented;
the lines correspond to the thigh, leg, and foot; the dots to
the joints at the ankle, knee, and hip.</p>

<p>This diagram shows pretty clearly the alterations of flexion
and extension of the leg on the thigh, the undulating
trajectories of the foot, knee, and hip, and yet the number
of images does not exceed sixty in a second. A revolving
shutter pierced with more holes would give more perfectly
the angular displacements of the leg on the thigh, and the
positions of the three joints. The finer the dotted lines expressing
the direction of the limbs, the more the images may
be multiplied; but in the present case, sixty times in a second
more than suffice to show the displacements of the limbs when
running.</p>

<p>In this photographic analysis the two factors of movements&mdash;time
and space&mdash;cannot be both estimated perfectly;
knowledge of the positions the body has occupied in space
requires that one should possess complete and distinct images;
in order to obtain such images, a sufficiently long space of
time must elapse between the two successive photographs.
If, on the contrary, it is desirable to estimate time more perfectly,
the frequency of recurrence of the image must be greatly
increased. To bring these two exigencies as closely
together as possible, lines and points must be chosen for the
partial photographs which best show the successive attitudes
of the body.</p>

<p>It is curious to see that this expression of successive attitudes
of the trunk and limbs, by means of a series of lines expressing
the direction of the bones, has been precisely adopted
by the ancient authors as being the most explicit and capable
of making the phases of a movement understood. Thus,
Vincent and Goiffon, in their remarkable work on the horse,
have tried to represent by lines at different angles the displacements
of the bones of limbs while taking a step.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to expatiate on the superiority photography
has over actual observation for this purpose, giving
the true positions of the limbs, while the eye is incapable
of taking in such rapid actions in such short spaces of
time.</p>

<p>At the commencement of this century the brothers Weber
had recourse to the same mode of representation to explain
the successive actions produced in the walk of a man. It
was by reducing the walker to the figure of a skeleton that
these eminent observers succeeded in presenting, without
confusion, a number of images expressing different attitudes.</p>

<p>The method of constructing the bright metal bands which
in the photograph explain the position of the joints, requires
special mention. As the length of exposure is very
short, a substance having great brilliancy must be employed.
The strips of metal are not equally luminous down their
entire length, because they do not reflect the solar rays at
the same angle; they present lines of unequal intensity on
the negatives. I have obtained the best results with small
strips of black wood with nails having hemispherical bright
metal heads driven in at regular intervals. Each little
rounded surface reflected the image of the sun very brilliantly.
In the photograph these lines of nails are reproduced as
dotted lines. At the ankle, knee, and hip joints, nails of
larger dimensions were inserted, showing these centers of
movement by a much larger dot.</p>

<p>Partial photographs obtained by this method allow of the
different acts of locomotion being analyzed, as well as the
movements of walking, running, or jumping.</p>

<h2 id="DETECTIVE_PHOTOGRAPHY">DETECTIVE PHOTOGRAPHY.</h2>

<p>For several years Mr. D. N. Carvalho, the New York
photographer, has made a specialty of the delicate use of
photography which is brought into play more and more in
connection with criminal cases in which disputed handwriting,
forgeries, counterfeit money, etc., are features.
The results now achieved are the outcome of years of experiment,
and the photographic expert becomes in the end
an expert in handwriting. Mr. Carvalho's gallery of records
is an interesting illustration of what perseverance and ingenuity,
aided by photography, can do toward solving apparently
hopeless mysteries. To a reporter, who visited his
studio, he said:</p>

<p>"We can do a great many things to bring the truth to
light by the aid of photography. There is scarcely a case
nowadays in which it is not brought into play if disputed
handwriting is concerned. Of course the most famous case
of late years was the Morey letter case. There is a photograph
of the Morey letter up there in a corner. It yet remains
a mystery, but we are certain that Garfield did not
write it. I first found by photography that the envelope
had been tampered with by the following process: Cutting
the envelope open, so as to get a single thickness of paper,
I put it between two sheets of plate glass, and placed it
where the sun passed through it, the camera being placed
on the shady side. Although no half-erased writing could
be detected on the envelope with the naked eye or a glass,
the difference in the thickness of the paper where erasures
had been made showed plainly, as the light came through
more clearly, and the erased words, which gave rise to so
much discussion, were discovered.</p>

<p>"Below the Morey letter is a photograph of the signature
of Alonzo C. Yates. Yates, you may remember, was a rich
Philadelphia clothier, who, late in life, married a cook in
the Astor House, and died, leaving a million or so to the
wife. The daughters by a first wife disputed the signature
to the will. I was employed by John D. Townsend to show
the genuineness of the signature. We got thirty or forty
genuine signatures of Yates admitted by both sides, and
showed that a man never writes his name the same way
twice. Then I took the signature of the will and another
admitted by both sides, and enlarged them until each was
9 feet 4 inches long. The peculiarities of the writing became
so apparent when shown upon that enormous scale&mdash;the
signatures were so evidently by the same person&mdash;that
the contestants gave up the case.</p>

<p>"There is a portrait of Theophilus Youngs. He married
a clairvoyant many years ago in Boston and disappeared.
His widow pretended to recognize his body in one that was
found in the bay soon after, and he was given up as dead.
Some years after his father died, and the widow put in a
claim for a share of the property. The contestants, by
whom I was employed, contended that Youngs was yet
alive, and eventually produced him in court. The alleged
widow refused to recognize him, and I was called upon to
prove he was the man. The widow produced a photograph
which she said was one of the pictures of Youngs, her husband.
A good many years had passed, and although the
likeness was a strong one, there was enough difference in
the appearance of Youngs and the photograph to make a
jury hesitate. I put Youngs in the same position in which
he was taken in the picture, the genuineness of which was
admitted, and made a photograph of the same size. Then
the likeness became more apparent, and exact measurements
showed the two faces to measure the same in all respects.
For instance, the distance between the mouth and the eye,
which is seldom the same in two persons, was exactly equal.
Then one picture was made transparent and superimposed
over the other, and the two faces matched perfectly. The
jury decided that the claimant was not an impostor.</p>

<p>"In the case of Hall, the head clerk of the Newark Treasurer's
office, everything depended upon showing that he
changed a figure 5 into a figure 3. He ran away to Canada,
and was brought back upon a charge of forgery. His counsel
claimed that the figure had not been changed, and that
if the mark of an eraser was found, and that the figure 5
had been changed, it was caused by the accidental slip of
an ink eraser used in the margin. I made photographs of
the page, and by means of a stereopticon threw a picture of
that particular figure upon a screen 10 feet high. Upon
that scale several interesting things came out. It was seen
very plainly that the figure had been altered from a 5 to a 3,
but the erasure had been made with a different material
from the erasure in the margin. We tried a rubber ink
eraser, and the result was the same as seen in the margin.
Then we tried a steel penknife, and the result enlarged a
thousand times was the same as seen over the figure 3. This
disposed of the 'accident' theory, and Hall was convicted.</p>

<p>"I was employed in the Cadet Whittaker case, and
worked for weeks at the famous letter of warning&mdash;a few
words scribbled on a piece of paper, which Whittaker was
suspected of writing. All the cadets were called upon to
give specimens of their handwriting, and the writing of No.
27 was declared by the experts to be that of the note of
warning. I believed that it was not, and, taking the specimen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6446">6446</span>
of No. 27's writing upon which he was suspected, I
duplicated the note of warning, cutting the same letters out
of 27's specimen, and placing them together as nearly as possible
in the order of the famous note. It was a work of
tremendous labor, but when done it showed the innocence
of No. 27. It was suspected that the scrap of paper upon
which the note of warning was written was torn from a letter
sheet which Whittaker sent to his mother, but that theory
was disposed of upon enlarging the two edges to the
size at which a fine cambric needle looks like a crowbar.
Then it was seen that the two edges had never been together.
The verdict in the Whittaker case was finally reversed
upon the ground that the court had come to a decision
from the examination of lithographs of the note of
warning, which I proved by comparison with a photograph
were incorrect. Whittaker, by the way, is teaching school
now in the northern part of this State. He made speeches
for Cleveland in his neighborhood during the election campaign
last autumn."</p>

<h2 id="THE_HISTORY_OF_THE_ELECTRIC_TELEGRAPH">[Continued from Supplement No. 384, page 6127.]<br />

THE HISTORY OF THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></h2>

<p>The first electric telegraph in which Volta's memorable
discovery was utilized was that of Soemmering, of Munich,
dating from 1809, and not from 1811 as the statement has
too oft been made in print. Soemmering was led to take
up electric telegraphy in a very curious way. It was during
the wars of the Empire. "It cannot be forgotten," says
Julius Zoellner, in the <i xml:lang="de">Buch der Erfindungen</i>, "that the so
rapid and consequently so fortunate enterprises of Napoleon
were especially favored by the admirable means of communication
which so rapidly transmitted the will of one
man to all parts of his army, and that it was very often
such rapidity alone that rendered its execution possible.</p>

<p>"The unfortunate blockade of General Mack in Ulm was
an example that Bavaria had seen from too close a distance
not to take it into account. And, when the entirely unexpected
invasion of the Austrians, on April 9, 1809, and
the flight of the King of Bavaria (who was obliged to leave
Munich on the 11th) were announced so quickly to Napoleon,
by the optic telegraph, that on the 22d of April
Munich, that had six days before been taken by the Austrians,
was occupied by the French, and when King Maximilian
was enabled to re-enter his residence sixteen days after
leaving it, then the Bavarian minister, Montgelas, directed
his attention seriously to the high importance of telegraphy.</p>

<p>"On the 5th of July, 1809, while dining with Soemmering,
a member of the Academy of Sciences of Munich, he expressed
to him a desire to have this scientific body propose
some systems of telegraphy. The savant accepted this idea
with the greatest eagerness, and, three days afterward, under
date of July 8, he wrote in his journal: ... 'Shall be
able to take rest only when I shall have realized telegraphy
by the disengagement of gas.'"</p>

<p>At this epoch, in fact, the decomposition of water was
the sole phenomenon known that would permit the electric
current to be used for telegraphy, and Soemmering had
rendered himself perfectly conversant with it. He at once
bought silver and copper wires, insulated them by means of
sealing wax, and, on the 8th of July, constructed his first
apparatus (Fig. 5). Five insulated rods, represented by the
letters, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, dipped into a vessel, E, containing acidulated
water. From these rods there started wires which,
combined into a cable, <i>x</i>, <i>x</i>, and insulated from each other
by sealing-wax, could be put in contact with the poles of a
Volta pile, S, of 15 elements, formed of zinc disks, Brabant
thalers, and felt soaked in dilute hydrochloric acid. On
causing a variation in the wires that he put in connection
with the poles of the pile, he was enabled to produce a disengagement
of gas upon any two definite rods, and thus to
transmit the letters that he had taken care to mark the different
wires with.</p>

<p>The possibility of the system was recognized, and Soemmering
at once had an apparatus constructed according to
it. On the 22d of July he received it from the hands of the
workman nearly such as it is shown in Fig. 6. The decomposing
reservoir was of an elongated rectangular shape containing
35 gold rods that corresponded to 25 letters and 10
figures. From these rods started 35 wires covered with silk
and combined into a bundle that was afterward covered
with melted shellac. At the other extremity of this cable
the wires ran to 35 pieces of copper fixed horizontally upon
a wooden support, and each provided with an aperture into
which could be inserted one of the pins in which the pile
wires terminated.</p>

<p>When these latter were put in connection with the pieces
corresponding to any two letters whatever, gas was observed
to disengage itself in the reservoir upon the two corresponding
rods, but in greater quantity on the one connected with
the negative pole. This fact was not lost upon Soemmering,
and he utilized it to render the dispatches more rapid;
for it allowed him to transmit two letters always at the
same time, with the proviso that the one upon the rod
from which most gas was disengaged had been written
first.</p>

<p>No demand arose for this first apparatus, so Soemmering
soon devised one that operated by the aid of a paddle-wheel
set in motion by the bubbles of gas. But, a little
later on, in August, 1810, he replaced this by another and
very ingenious apparatus which is shown in Fig. 6. An
inverted spoon, arranged horizontally in the liquid, collected
in its bowl the gases that were disengaged from certain
rods, and then, rising, caused the inclination at the same
time of a rod bent at right angles. This latter thereupon
allowed a small copper ball to drop into a glass funnel, from
whence it fell upon a cup attached to the end of a lever,
and, through its weight, threw into gear a bell operated by
a clockwork movement.</p>

alt="" /></a>
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 5&mdash;SOEMMERING'S FIRST TELEGRAPH.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1811, Soemmering simplified his apparatus as regards
the number of signs. Instead of having 25 letters (a complete
alphabet minus <i>x</i>) and 10 figures, he did away with
these latter and the letter J, and introduced the <i>x</i>, the
period, and a sign of repetition. The apparatus was thus
reduced to 27 wires.</p>

<p>The first experiments in telegraphy made with this system,
on the 9th of July, 1809, were over a distance of 38 feet;
on the 19th, transmission was effected to 170 feet; and, on
the 8th of August, to 1,000 feet; but it was not until he had
perfected the insulation of his wires by means of India
rubber dissolved in ether, and had devised his paddle-wheel
call, that Soemmering decided to present his telegraph to the
Academy of Sciences of Bavaria during its session of August
28, 1809.</p>

<p>Some time afterward, Baron Larrey, Inspector General of
the medical service of the French armies, carried Soemmering's
telegraph to Paris and presented it to the Academy of
Sciences at its session of December 5, 1809. This presentation
gave rise to a series of letters addressed by Soemmering
to the Baron. His son, now a member of the Academy, has
had the goodness to communicate these to Count du Moncel,
through whose kindness we are enabled to cite the most
interesting passages from them.</p>

<p>Soemmering writes on the 10th of November:</p>

<p>"I have the honor to remit to you herewith a memoir
which, conjointly with the trifles that you have had the
goodness to charge yourself with, will explain my meaning
clearly and briefly. I am desirous of learning the reception
that His Imperial Majesty deigned to accord to these ideas.
The memoir, as you will see, sir, makes mention, aphoristically,
of a few quite varied experiments that I have been
in a position to perform. I dare to flatter myself that they
will please several members of the Institute. Independent
of the major interest of which they seem susceptible, that
of novelty belongs to them. In my opinion, there is no one
who can dispute it...."</p>

<p>On the 5th of December, 1809, as we have said, the telegraph
was presented to the Institute, but the inventor does
not seem to have been at once informed of it; for he writes,
under date of July 30, 1810:</p>

<p>"I have, sir, read your dissertation upon my telegraph
with great pleasure.... Has my succinct memoir on the
telegraph, sent from here on the 12th of November, reached
you, sir, and have you had the goodness to communicate it
to the Institute?</p>

<p>"As the old wires that were pretty badly treated by
many manipulations had really suffered therefrom, and as
it was only to save time that I did not have them renewed
before sending the apparatus, I wish that they could be
replaced by ordinary clavichord wires wound with silk, inasmuch
as the material in these is more durable than the
copper of the old ones. Had I been able to flatter myself,
sir, that you would have taken enough interest in this invention
to be at the trouble of carrying it to Paris, I should
certainly not have failed to effect in advance this small and
necessary improvement, which, leaving time out of consideration,
will require but a care as to details. For, in
fact, I strongly apprehend that not only the brittleness of
the copper wire, but also the violence that trials anterior
and even foreign to present use have submitted these wires
to, have possibly got the silk out of order, or used it up here
and there, thus producing immediate contacts of metal and
bringing about a premature closing of the galvanic chain,
whence would result a total disarrangement of the questions.
I truly regret, then, having (through being too jealous of
time, which you yourself know so well the value of) sent
you the instrument in such a state of imperfection, and I
cannot do better than ask to have it sent back here in good
order. Permit me, then, to ask you at once to please not
let Prince de Neufchatel nor even His Majesty the Emperor
see it until the said repair has been effected, either by myself
or (if the sending back would seem to you to take too
long) by some one of our skillful artists at Paris. According
to my convictions, there is but this means of preventing
its effect from failing us, even for ever. It is a true pleasure
to see it so infallible and complete as it is in the new
instrument of absolutely the same structure that I have had
constructed for the Academy of Munich."</p>

<p>The telegraph, which doubtless was repaired at Paris,
was returned to Munich only in May, 1811. The same year
it was carried to Vienna by the Russian Count Potocki,
whom Baron Schilling had made known to Soemmering,
and who presented the apparatus to Emperor Francis the
First, on the 1st of July of the same year. Another model
was sent by Soemmering to his son William, then at Geneva,
who showed it to Augustus Pictet, to De la Rive, and to
some other savants.</p>

<p>Despite all such presentations no high personage showed
himself disposed to aid Soemmering in making an extended
application of his invention. The committee named by the
Academy of Sciences, and in which figured Monge, Biot,
and Carnot, does not seem to have made any report.
The apparatus was considered of small importance alongside
of that of Claude Chappe, and Napoleon himself, says
Mr. Zoellner, treated the invention as a German vision. On
another hand, Bavaria and Austria showed just as little enthusiasm;
but Soemmering, reduced to his own resources,
continued his experiments none the less on that account.
On the 4th of February, 1812, he found it possible to telegraph
to a distance of 4,000 feet, and on the 15th of March
of the same year he operated his apparatus with complete
success over a line 10,000 feet in length.</p>

<p>This was certainly making great progress; but it is certain
that, even if Soemmering had not encountered universal
indifference, his telegraph would not have been able to
become practical, because of the large number of wires employed.
A modification, however, would have enabled it
to play a role during the twenty-five years which preceded
the invention of more easily realizable systems. This modification
is the one Salomon Christopher Schweigger proposed
in an appendix to the memoir of Soemmering inserted
by him in 1811<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> in his journal, the <cite>Polytechnisches Central&mdash;Blatt.</cite></p>

<p>His proposition was that two unequal piles should be employed
instead of one, so that first one and then the other,
or even the two combined, should act; and, besides, that
the number of wires should be reduced to two, in taking
into consideration the time during which the gases were
disengaged, as well as the interruptions of varying length,
and to which would succeed the action, first of the larger,
and then of the smaller pile. With these different modifications,
it certainly would have been possible to employ but
two wires, and to render the laying of the wires less
costly.</p>

<p>After Soemmering, we may cite in the same category John
Redman Coxe, who, according to a note inserted in 1810 in
the <cite>Annals of Philosophy</cite>, proposed to utilize for telegraphy
the decomposition of water or metallic salts. Coxe, however,
does not seem to have ever made any experiments.</p>

<p>In 1814 John Robert Sharpe claimed likewise to have
made experiments in telegraphy in 1813; and these in all
probability were based upon electro-chemical action.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the only important one of these electro-chemical
apparatus is that of Soemmering. This marks an
epoch in the history of electric telegraphy, but it was not
capable of the extension that can be given the apparatus
based upon Oersted's discovery.</p>

<h2 id="A_NEW_SULPHATE_OF_COPPER_PILE">A NEW SULPHATE OF COPPER PILE.</h2>

<p>Some studies made of the telegraph service of the Railway
Company of the East (France) have resulted in a happy
modification of the Callaud pile, rendering it easier of maintenance
and reducing the consumption of the materials employed.</p>

<p>As well known, the Callaud pile, which is exclusively
employed for telegraphic purposes by certain railroad companies,
consists of a glass vessel, of a circular piece of zinc
suspended by hooks from the upper part of the vessel, and
of a strip of copper resting on the bottom of the latter.
This copper strip is riveted to a rod of the same metal
which constitutes the positive electrode. In the bottom of
the vessel there is placed a saturated solution of sulphate
of copper, so that its level reaches to within a short distance
of the lower part of the zinc, and the vessel is then filled
with pure water. The zinc being attacked, there is formed
a zinc sulphate, which always remains at the upper part of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6447">6447</span>
the vessel by reason of the difference in density of the solutions
of sulphate of zinc and sulphate of copper, and the reduced
copper deposits upon the strip in the center. It has
been found necessary to cover the copper rod with a sheath
of gutta-percha in order to keep it from being cut at the
line of intersection of the two liquids, and this is the first
inconvenience of the system. It is necessary, moreover,
to keep the solution of copper at a certain degree of concentration
by placing in the bottom of the vessel a supply
of crystals of sulphate of copper. Hence it happens that the
solution, being increased, eventually reaches the zinc, and
the latter is thereupon attacked to no purpose, with a pure
loss of copper through reduction. This is a second inconvenience,
which can be remedied by introducing into the
pile only a simply saturated solution without excess of crystals.
It will be seen that, in this latter case, it is necessary
to visit the pile quite frequently, to empty it by means of
siphons, and to confide its maintenance to experienced persons
only.</p>

<p>This is why, up to the present, railroad companies have
preferred the Daniell to the Callaud pile for alarm bells
that control signal disks, despite the serious advantages
of the Callaud pile and the inconvenience of the porous
vessel that enters into the composition of the other.</p>

<p class="caption">NEW SULPHATE OF COPPER PILE.</p>
</div>

<p>The modified Callaud pile is exempt from the defects that
we have just pointed out. It differs from the old form in
the substitution of a leaden tube, open at its extremities
and dipping into the liquid of the pile, for the piece of copper
or positive electrode. The lead, which is not attacked,
and may serve indefinitely, is held in a vertical position by
means of a foot made by cutting slits with a pair of scissors
in the bottom of the tube, and bending back the strips thus
formed. This foot also serves to prevent the tube from
touching the zinc, by holding it in equilibrium.</p>

<p>In order to charge the element thus constituted, it is only
necessary to fill the lead tube with crystals of sulphate of
copper and to pour water into the glass vessel until its level
reaches within a centimeter and a half of the upper edge of
the zinc. In an hour the copper will have dissolved sufficiently
to allow the pile to begin its action.</p>

<p>Experience has demonstrated that, whatever be the supply
of copper that is put into the lead tube, the saturated
solution <i>will never reach the zinc</i>, even in an open circuit.</p>

<p>In sum, the new arrangement given to the Callaud element
presents the following advantages: (1) It permits
of the maintenance being confided to anybody, since this
consists simply in the introduction into the central tube
of crystals of sulphate of copper when it is seen that
the blue tint of the lower liquid is disappearing. (2) It permits
of proportioning the expense to the work really effected.&mdash;<cite>La

<p>In Brooklyn, the Connecticut brownstone is the variety
predominating among the stone buildings (95.7 per cent.),
and is employed almost altogether for the fronts of residences.
Very few iron buildings occur, but over three times
as many stucco fronts as in New York. The frame buildings
predominate, particularly in the outskirts, <i>e. g.</i>, Long
Island City (80.5 per cent).</p>

<p>In Staten Island, stone enters in very small proportion
into the fronts of buildings, though commonly employed, as
in New York and throughout this district, for the dressing
of apertures, the walls of inclosures, and other masonry.</p>

<p>In Jersey City, the proportions of the materials are much
as in Staten Island. The selection of the dark trap from the
Heights behind the city, for the construction of many fronts
or entire buildings, is a local feature of interest.</p>

<p>In Hoboken, the same general features prevail as in Jersey
City.</p>

<p>The annual reports of the Committee on Fire Patrol of the
New York Board of Fire Underwriters, for the years 1881
and 1882, have yielded the following statistics, which, so far

<p>In addition to the edifices referred to above, many public
buildings of importance are constructed of stone, <i>e. g.</i>: Prisons
in the city and on the islands, bridges in the parks and
over the Harlem River, in which sandstone, limestone, granyte,
and gneiss are used.</p>

<p>The sewers are constructed of gneiss from New York
Island and vicinity, as well as of bowlders of trap, granyte,
etc., from excavations.</p>

<p>The Croton Aqueduct, the High Bridge, the Reservoirs in
the Central and Prospect Parks and at 42d Street, in which
gneiss from the vicinity and granyte from New England were used.</p>

<p>The walls, buildings, bridges, and general masonry in the
parks are constructed of the following varieties of stone:</p>

<p>Freestone (sandstone), from Albert, Dorchester, and Weston,
N. B.</p>

<p>Brownstone, from Belleville and the base of the Palisades,
N. J.</p>

<p>Bluestone and "mountain graywacke," from the Hudson

<p>The fortifications in the harbor and entrance to the sound,
constructed of granyte from Dix Island, Spruce Head, etc.,
Me., gneiss from the vicinity, brownstone from Conn., etc.</p>

<p>The stonework of the New York and Brooklyn Bridge,
as I am kindly informed by Mr. F. Collingwood, the engineer
in charge of the New York approach, is constructed of the
following materials:</p>

<p>Granyte, from Frankfort, Spruce Head, Hurricane Island,
East Blue Hill and Mt. Desert, Me., Concord, N. H., Cape
Ann, Mass., Westerly, R. I., Stony Creek, Conn., and Charlottesburg,
N. J.</p>

<p>Limestone, from Rondout and Kingston, N. Y., also from
Isle La Motte and Willsboro Point, Lake Champlain, and
vicinity of Catskill, N. Y.</p>

<p>In the anchorages, the corner stones, exterior of the cornice
and coping, and the stones resting on anchor plates,
consist of granyte from Charlottesburg and Stony Creek, in
the New York anchorage, and from Westerly, in the Brooklyn
anchorage. The rest of the material is entirely limestone,
mainly from Rondout, largely from Lake Champlain.
In the towers, limestone was chiefly employed below the
water line, and, above, granyte from all the localities named,
except Charlottesburg, Westerly, and Stony Creek. In the
approaches the materials were arranged in about the same
way as in the towers. Additional particulars are given concerning
the quantity, prices, tests of strength, and reasons
for selection of the varieties of stone.</p>

<p>For roofing, slate is largely employed throughout these
cities, being mainly derived from Poultney, Castleton, Fairhaven,
etc., Vt., and Slatington, Lynnport, Bethlehem, etc.,
Penn.</p>

<p>For pavements, the bowlders of trap and granyte from excavations
have been widely used in the "cobblestone" pavements.
The trap (or diabase) of the Palisades across the
Hudson, immediately opposite New York city, and from
Graniteville, Staten Island, is used in the "Russ" and Belgian
pavement; also, granyte from the Highlands of the
Hudson, from Maine, etc, in the "granite block" pavement
in both New York and Brooklyn; large quantities of
crushed trap from Weehawken and Graniteville, for the
macadamized streets and roads in the parks and outskirts;
and also wood, concrete, and asphalt in various combinations.</p>

<p>For sidewalks and curbstones, the material generally employed
is the flagstone, a thinly bedded blue sandstone or
graywacke from the interior of the State, the Catskill Mountains,
and from Pennsylvania; also, granyte, chiefly from
Maine. In the older streets, a mica slate from Bolton, Conn.,
and micaceous slaty gneiss from Haddam, Conn., were once
largely used, and may still be occasionally observed in
scattered slabs.</p>

<p>Additional facts were given concerning the ruling prices
for the varieties of stone, tables presenting all the determinations
obtainable in reference to the crushing strength of
the varieties used in New York, lists of the dealers in building
and ornamental stones, etc.</p>

<h3 id="dobs">III. DURABILITY OF BUILDING STONES, IN NEW CITY AND
VICINITY.</h3>

<p>All varieties of soft, porous, and untested stones are being
hurried into the masonry of the buildings of New York city
and its vicinity. On many of them the ravages of the weather
and the need of the repairer are apparent within five years
after their erection, and a resistance to much decay for
twenty or thirty years is usually considered wonderful and
perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the general injury to the appearance of
the rotten stone, and the enormous losses annually involved
in the extensive repairs, painting, or demolition, little concern
is yet manifested by either architects, builders, or house
owners. Hardly any department of technical science is so
much neglected as that which embraces the study of the
nature of stone, and all the varied resources of lithology in
chemical, microscopical, and physical methods of investigation,
wonderfully developed within the last quarter century,
have never yet been properly applied to the selection and
protection of stone, as used for building purposes. Much
alarm has been caused abroad in the rapid decay and fast
approaching ruin of the most important monuments, cathedrals,
and public buildings, but in many instances the means
have been found for their artificial protection, <i>e. g.</i>, the
Louvre, and many palaces in and near Paris, France, St.
Charles Church in Vienna, Austria, the Houses of Parliament,
etc., in London, England, etc.</p>

<p>In New York, the Commissioners of the Croton Aqueduct
Department complained, twenty years ago, of the crumbling
away of varieties of the gneiss used in embankments; the
marbles of Italy, Vermont, and of Westchester county soon
become discolored, are now all more or less pitted or softened
upon the surface (<i>e. g.</i>, the U. S. Treasury), and are
not likely to last a century in satisfactory condition (<i>e. g.</i>, the
U. S. Hotel); the coarser brown sandstones are exfoliating in
the most offensive way throughout all of our older streets
and in many of the newer (<i>e. g.</i>, the old City Hall); the few
limestones yet brought into use are beginning to lose their
dressed surfaces and to be traversed by cracks (<i>e. g.</i>, the
Lenox Library); and even the granytes, within a half century,
show both discoloration, pitting (<i>e. g.</i>, the Custom
House), or exfoliation (<i>e. g.</i>, the Tombs). To meet and properly
cope with this destructive action, requires, first, a
clear recognition of the hostile external agencies concerned
in the process. These belong to three classes: chemical,
physical, and organic.</p>

<p>The chemical agencies discussed were the following: sulphurous
and sulphuric acids, discharged in vast quantities
into the air of the city, by the combustion of coal and gas,
the decomposition of street refuse and sewer gas, etc.; carbonic,
nitric, and hydrochloric acids; carbolic, hippuric,
and many other organic acids derived from smoke, street
dust, sewer vapors, etc.; oxygen and ozone, ammonia, and
sea salt.</p>

<p>The mechanical and physical agencies discussed were the
following: frost; extreme variations in temperature, amounting
in our climate to 120° F. in a year, and even 70° in a
single day; wind and rain, most efficient on fronts facing the
north, northeast, and east; crystallization by efflorescence;
pressure of superincumbent masonry; friction; and fire.</p>

<p>The organic agencies consist of vegetable growths, mostly
confervæ, etc., within the city, and lichens and mosses
without, and of boring mollusks, sponges, etc.</p>

<p>The internal elements of durability in a stone depend, first,
upon the chemical composition of its constituent minerals
and of their cement. This involves a consideration of their
solubility in atmospheric waters, <i>e. g.</i>, the calcium-carbonate
of a marble or limestone, the ferric oxide of certain sandstones,
etc.; their tendency to oxidation, hydration, and decomposition,
<i>e. g.</i>, of the sulphides (especially marcasite) in
a roofing slate or marble, the biotite and ferruginous orthoclase
in a granyte or sandstone, etc.; the inclosure of fluids
and moisture, <i>e. g.</i>, as "quarry-sap," in chemical combination,
as hydrated silicates (chlorite, kaolin, etc.), and iron
oxides, and as fluid cavities locked up in quartz, etc.</p>

<p>The durability of a stone depends again upon its physical
structure, in regard to which the following points were discussed:
the size, form, and position of its constituent minerals;
<i>e. g.</i>, an excess of mica plates in parallel position may
serve as an element of weakness; the porosity of the rock
permitting the percolation of water through its interstices,
especially important in the case of the soft freestones, and
leading to varieties of discoloration upon the light-colored
stones, which were described in detail; the hardness and
toughness, particularly in relation to use for pavements,
sidewalks, and stoops; the crystalline structure, which, if
well-developed, increases the strength of its resistance; the
tension of the grains, which appears to explain especially
the disruption of many crystalline marbles; the contiguity of
the grains and the proportion of cement in their interstices;
and the homogeneity of the rock.</p>

<p>Again, the durability of a rock may depend upon the
character of its surface, whether polished, smoothly dressed,
or rough hewn, since upon this circumstance may rest the
rapidity with which atmospheric waters are shed, or with
which the deposition of soot, street dust, etc., may be favored;
also upon the inclination and position of the surface, as
affecting the retention of rainwater and moisture, exposure
to northeast gales and to burning sun, etc.</p>

<h3 id="motobs">IV. METHODS OF TRIAL OF BUILDING STONE.</h3>

<p>In such methods, two classes may be distinguished, the
natural and the artificial.</p>

<p>The former embrace, first, the examination of quarry outcrops,
where the exposure of the surface of the rock during
ages may give some indication of its power of resistance to
decomposition, <i>e. g.</i>, the dolomitic marbles of New York and
Westchester counties, some of which present a surface crumbling
into sand; and, secondly, the examination of old masonry.
Few old buildings have survived the changes in our
restless city, but many observations were presented in regard
to the condition of many materials, usually after an exposure
of less than half a century.</p>

<p>Another source of information, in this regard, was found
in the study of the stones erected in our oldest cemeteries,
<i>e. g.</i>, that of Trinity Church. There could hardly be devised
a superior method for thoroughly testing by natural means
the durability of the stone than by its erection in this way,
with partial insertion in the moist earth, complete exposure
to the winds, rain, and sun on every side, its bedding lamination
standing on edge, and several of its surfaces smoothed
and polished and sharply incised with dates, inscriptions,
and carvings, by which to detect and to measure the character
and extent of its decay. In Trinity Churchyard, the
stones are vertical, and stand facing the east. The most
common material is a red sandstone, probably from Little
Falls, N. J., whose erection dates back as far as 1681, and
which remains, in most cases, in very fair condition. Its
dark color, however, has led to a frequent tendency to splitting
on the western side of the slabs, <i>i. e.</i>, that which faces
the afternoon sun. Other materials studied consisted of
bluestone, probably from the Catskills, black slate, gray
slate, green hydromicaceous schist, and white oolitic limestone,
all in good condition, and white marble, in a decided
state of decay.</p>

<p>The artificial methods of trial of stone, now occasionally
in vogue, whenever some extraordinary pressure is brought
upon architects to pay a little attention to the durability of
the material they propose to employ, are, from their obsolete
antiquity, imperfection, or absolute inaccuracy, unworthy of
the age and of so honorable a profession. They usually consist
of trials of solubility in acids, of absorptive power for
water, of resistance to frost, tested by the efflorescence of
sodium-sulphate, and of resistance to crushing. The latter
may have the remotest relationship to the elements of durability
in many rocks, and yet is one on which much reliance
of the architectural world is now placed. Sooner or later a
wide departure will take place from these incomplete and
antique methods, in the light of modern discovery.</p>

<p>Reference was made to certain experiments by Professor
J. C. Draper on the brownstone and Nova Scotia stone used
in this city, by Dr. Page, on a series of the building stones,
and by Professors J. Henry and W. R. Johnson on American
marbles, in some cases with conflicting results, which
were probably due to the limited number and methods of
the experiments.</p>

<h3 id="mopapos">V. MEANS OF PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION OF STONE.</h3>

<p>We have here to consider certain natural principles of construction,
and then the methods for the artificial preservation
of the stone used in buildings. Under the first head, there
are four divisions.</p>

<p><i>Selection of Stone.</i>&mdash;As it is universally agreed that the utmost
importance rests upon the original selection of the
building material, it is here that all the resources of lithological
science should be called in. Only one investigation,
aiming at thorough work, has ever been carried through,
that of the Royal Commission appointed for the selection of
stone for the Houses of Parliament. But the efforts of these
able men were restricted by the little progress made at that
time in the general study of rocks, and were afterward completely
thwarted by the discharge of the committee and by
the delivery of the execution of the work of selection to incompetent
hands. There will be hereafter, from investigations
made in the light of modern researches, no excuse for
such annoying results and enormous expenses as those which
attended the endless repairs which have been required, since
a period of four or five years after the completion of the
great building referred to.</p>

<p><i>Seasoning.</i>&mdash;The recommendations of Vitruvius 2,000 years
ago have been observed at times down to the day of Sir Christopher
Wren, who would not accept the stone which he proposed
to use in the erection of St. Paul's Cathedral, in London,
until it had laid for three years, seasoning upon the
seashore. Since then little or no attention appears to have
been paid to this important requirement by modern architects,
in the heedless haste of the energy of the times. Building
stone, even for many notable edifices, is hurried from the
quarries into its position in masonry, long before the "quarry-sap"
has been permitted, by its evaporation to produce solid
cementation in the interstices of the stone.</p>

<p><i>Position.</i>&mdash;The danger of setting up any laminated material
on edge, rather than on its natural bedding-plane, has
been widely acknowledged; yet it is of the rarest occurrence,
in New York city, to observe any attention paid to
this rule, except where, from the small size or square
form of the blocks of stone employed, it has been really
cheapest and most convenient to pile them up on their
flat sides.</p>

<p><i>Form of Projections.</i>&mdash;The principle is maintained by all
the best English and French architects that projections (<i>i. e</i>.,
cornices, sills, lintels, etc.) should be "throated," that is,
undercut in such a way as to throw off the dripping of rainwater,
etc., from the front of the building, but in New
York this principle is almost universally neglected. It was
pointed out that the severity of our climate even requires
the further care that the upper surface of projections should
be so cut as to prevent the lodgment or long retention of
deposits either of rainwater or snow. It is immediately
above and below such deposits that the ashlar of our fronts
is most rapidly corroded and exfoliated, an effect evidently
due mainly to the repeated thawing and solution, freezing
and disintegration, which are caused by the water, slush,
and snow, which rest, often for weeks, upon a window-sill,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6449">6449</span>
balcony, cornice, etc. Thus from the initial and inexcusable
carelessness in the construction and form of the projections,
and, later, the neglect of the houseowner, due to
ignorance of the results involved, to remove the deposits of
snow, etc., as fast as they accumulate on the projections, is
derived a large part of the discoloration of the marble, Nova
Scotia stone, or light colored granyte, and especially the exfoliation
of the brownstone beneath the window-sills, balconies,
etc., by the water alternately trickling down the
front and freezing, by day and by night, for long periods.</p>

<p>The artificial means of preservation are of two classes,
organic and inorganic. The former depend on the application
of some organic substance in a coating or in the injection
of fatty matters; but, as the substances are with greater
or less rapidity oxidized, dissolved, and carried away by
the atmospheric fluids, the methods founded on their use
have been properly denounced by many authorities as only
costly palliatives, needing frequent repetition, and therefore
exerting an influence toward the destruction of delicate
carving. The following were discussed: coal-tar; paint,
which has been used in New York for many residences, as
in Washington for the Capitol, and in London for Buckingham
Palace, etc., but lasts only a few years, and often even
permits the disintegration to progress beneath it; oil, often
used in New York, but as objectionable as paint; soap and
alum-solution; and paraffine, beeswax, resin, tallow, etc.,
dissolved in naphtha, turpentine, camphene, oil, etc.</p>

<p>The preparations of an inorganic nature, which have
been proposed and used abroad, have in some cases met
with success; but the exact nature of their action, and the
conditions to which they are each suited, are yet to be investigated,
especially with reference to the entirely different
climate by which the stone in our city is being tried. The
processes which have been proposed, and in some cases
practically used, involve the application of the following
substances: waterglass, in connection with salts of calcium
or barium, or bitumen; oxalate of aluminum; barium solution,
in connection with calcium superphosphate or ferro-silicic
acid; copper salts, used by Dr. Robert in Paris to
stop the growth of vegetation on stone, etc. There is certainly
a call for processes by which, at least, those stones
which are used in isolated, exposed, and unnatural positions
may receive artificial protection, such as the stone
sills and lintels of windows, stone balusters, projecting
cornices, and ashlar-stone set up on edge. It will doubtless
be found that only those stones which possess a coarse,
porous texture and strong absorptive power for liquids will
be found particularly available for protection by artificial
preservatives, and that such stones should indeed never be
used in construction in a raw or crude state. In the spongy
brown and light olive free-stones, a marble full of minute
crevices, and a cellular fossiliferous limestone, a petrifying
liquid may permeate to some depth, close up the pores by
its deposits, and incase the stone in solid armor; while,
upon a more compact rock, such as a granyte or solid limestone,
it can only deposit a shelly crust or enamel, which
time may soon peel off. The carelessness with which stone
is selected and used, and the ignorance in regard to its proper
preservation, when the decay of a poor stone becomes
apparent, have led to an increased use of brick and terra
cotta, much to be deplored; durable stones are to be obtained
in great variety, methods for the preservation of the
porous stones can easily be devised, and stones of a fireproof
character do exist in this country in abundance.</p>

<p>In conclusion, three suggestions were offered: 1st, that
householders invoke the magic use of the broom on the
fronts of their residences as carefully as upon the sidewalks;
2d, that house-builders insist upon the undercutting
of all projections, and the exclusion of brackets or other
supports to sills and cornices, which only lead to the oozing
of water and a line of corrosion down the ashlar; 3d, that
house repairers recut the projections in this way, whenever
possible, and entirely avoid the use of paint, oil, or other
organic preservatives.</p>

<h2 id="ELEPHANTS_MOVING_TIMBER_AT_MOULMEIN_BURMAH">ELEPHANTS MOVING TIMBER AT MOULMEIN, BURMAH.</h2>

<p>"Elephants," says Mrs. A. H. Brackenbury, of Singapore,
to whom we are indebted for our sketch, "work in the timber
yards of Moulmein, carrying huge planks, sometimes
two or three together, and with great care and exactitude
piling them in stacks one over another. The old hands take
a sidelong view with one eye closed to test the perpendicularity
of the stacks. The elephants lift the planks with
their proboscis on their tusks, and then tuck their trunks
around the burden, and march majestically off as if they
were carrying nothing. A man sits on each elephant's
neck to direct him, which he does by kicking or pressing
behind their ears.</p>

<p>"In Africa the elephants are being so persistently slaughtered
for the sake of their ivory that they are likely soon to
become extinct.</p>

<p>"Would it be possible to breed them on farms as ostriches
are bred, and then to employ them in navvy work, for
which they are probably as well suited (education being supplied)
as their Asiatic cousins?</p>

<p>"Moulmein is a very pretty place, and its charms are enhanced
by its being out of the beaten track of tourists. It
is up a river, and there are many islands on which are perched
the daintiest little gilt and painted Burmese pagodas. The
scene recalls the well known view on the willow-pattern
plate of our childhood, which plate has once more become
fashionable."&mdash;<cite>London Graphic</cite>.</p>

<h2 id="STRENGTH_OF_YELLOW_PINE">STRENGTH OF YELLOW PINE.</h2>

<p>It is reported that a comparison of the relative strength
of yellow and Norway pine was made at Dayton, O., with
the following results: The specimens were dressed exactly
one inch square, and these were broken in a testing
machine by placing them on bearings, one foot apart, with
the weight in the center. The southern pine had been air
seasoned for two years and upward, the Norway from a
year to fifteen months. The weakest yellow pine broke at
763 pounds, the strongest at 1,102; average of eight specimens,
904 pounds. The weakest Norway broke at 501
pounds, the strongest at 790 pounds; average of ten specimens,
702 pounds, showing the yellow pine to be 28.7 per
cent. stronger than Norway, and that a yellow pine sill 4x8
inches dimensions is equivalent to a Norway sill of 5½x8
inches, with the further advantage in favor of the yellow
pine that it can be got much freer of knots and consequently
stronger in comparison than these figures show, which are
based on clear timber. Another test was made at a meeting
of the Master Car Builders' Association, with the following
results: Five pieces of each variety, one inch square and
eleven inches between bearing points, were experimented
upon, the pressure being applied in the center. The outcome
showed strength of yellow pine at 500, 510, 500, 490, and 530
pounds breakage strain, or an average of 506; while Norway
stood a strain of 620, 645, 730, 650, and 630 pounds or an
average of 625 pounds. These experiments do not appear to
throw much light on the question of relative strength.</p>

<h2 id="THE_EDUCATION_OF_GERMAN_WOMEN">THE EDUCATION OF GERMAN WOMEN.</h2>

<p>"Our women in Germany," said the professor of a German
university to me, a few days ago, "must by all means
be acquainted with the different departments of housekeeping,
and must interest themselves therein. Those who
stand highest as well as those who stand lowest, from the
wives and daughters of a Minister of State to the wives
and daughters of the meanest peasant. The Princess-Royal
attends to the skimming of the milk in her dairy." "I beg
your pardon for interrupting you," I said, "but an American
lady would think that quite out of her sphere; and if I
were not convinced of your seriousness, I should imagine
you were amusing me by a piece of fiction." "I do assure
you," replied the professor, "that it is a well known fact
that the Princess-Royal keeps cows and superintends personally
the management of her dairy, and I have heard that the
Queen of England does the same." "Please to instruct
me further regarding the education of women in Germany,"
I said. "I am very much interested in that subject, as,
from my own observations, I have seen that as a general
thing the German ladies are well read, not only in the
literature of their own country, but also in that of France
and England." "Our women," he replied, "also speak
French and English, especially French, and many of them
are able to read the authors of those countries in the original."
"This is the more surprising to me," I remarked,
"as they seem to be much occupied with the cares of
housekeeping, and I would like to know how they find
time to learn foreign languages, and to read all the principal
works of the poets and romance writers of three countries."
"That," said the professor, "is a part of their education,
and in order that you may understand in what manner
German girls must utilize their time at school, I
will give you a brief explanation of the system of education
employed and of that knowledge which it is incumbent upon
every German girl to possess, whatever be her position in
life, and afterward of the different grades of education from
that of the peasant girl to that of the lady of the highest
position in the State. Every girl in Germany must learn to
read and to write, to sew and to knit, to cook and to do general
housework, and to acquire besides some general knowledge
of grammar, geography, mathematics, and history.
Beginning at the daughter of the <i>Bauer</i>, or, as you say in
America, <i>farmer</i>, the above mentioned knowledge, which is
the starting point for the education of the other classes, is the
limit of her education; and as it may be interesting to you, I
will mention that when the daughters of the Bauer have
learned thus much they quit school and labor in the field until
they are married, when they leave aside the field work and
enter upon the duties of the household and its immediate
attachments, such as the dairy, the chicken yard, the gardens,
etc.; and while the products of the field belong to their
husbands, the garden stuffs, and the milk, eggs, butter, etc.,
become their own property, and from the profits of these,
which they carry to the markets and sell, they provide their
pantries with the necessary teas, sugar, coffee, etc., and
themselves and their children with clothes.</p>

<p>"Between the peasant class and nobility there are many
grades and classes varying more or less in the refinement of
their manners as well as in the extent of their education, but
as it would not be possible and is also unnecessary for our
purpose to describe them all in particular, I prefer to include
them all under the head of gentry, and for these a more
ample education is provided. The daughters of the gentry
must, in addition to the aforesaid rudiments of knowledge,
have a very thorough education in history as well as in
grammar, mathematics, and natural and physical geography.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6450">6450</span>
They must know French and English, and have an intelligent
understanding of the literature of those countries, as
well as of that of Germany. They must learn fine needle-work
and the art of governing a house and of educating young
children. They must also acquire a knowledge of good
manners and an understanding of society. They must be
able to receive company and do the honors of the house. In
addition to this they will have an intelligent understanding
of music and art. For all of these branches of knowledge
there are schools provided, and according to the position or
wealth of the parents, or the intelligence and application of
the daughters, will vary the refinement and education of each.
As, for instance, the education of a country squire's daughter
will be superior to that of a wholesale merchant's daughter,
and that of the wholesale merchant's daughter will be
superior to that of the retail merchant's daughter. The
daughter of a very wealthy banker will be educated above
the daughters of the merchants; the daughter of a professor
of the University above that of the daughters of a professor
of the Gymnasium, and so on; and each will fill a position
in life differing from that of the others, according to the
respect in which the position of the parents is held.</p>

<p>"The same system of education which we have described
for the daughters of the gentry will be incumbent on the
daughters of the nobility, with the addition of a more finished
and thorough education in regard to the manners and
formalities which attach to their station of life, and these
will also vary in kind and extent, according to the position
of the persons concerned. A Duke's daughter, for instance,
will be more accomplished than a Count's. But the difference
will be more apparent than real; the actual knowledge
of both will, as far as their education provides, be the same.
In the society of the Court, the ladies will naturally acquire
some knowledge of the affairs of State, which those in private
life and a more retired existence will not care to learn.
But in matters of art, in literature, in the general business
of life, all German ladies are expected to be well informed
and to be able to converse intelligently regarding them,
while the special faculties of law, of medicine, of theology,
of chemistry, etc., etc., are left to the higher ambition of
their fathers and brothers, and they do not meddle
with them. But, above all, as I remarked in the beginning,
a German girl of whatever rank or condition must understand
fully all the matters concerning a <i>household</i>."</p>

<p>When the Professor had finished, I thanked him and expressed
so much admiration at the system of education provided
for the women of Germany, that he promised me at
some future time a brief explanation of morals and manners
in Germany, which I shall be most happy to present before
the reader at the proper time. <span class="author">K.G.D.</span></p>

<h2 id="SCIENCE_IN_ANTIQUITY">SCIENCE IN ANTIQUITY.<br />

<small>HERON'S PNEUMATIC AND COMPRESSING APPARATUS</small>.</h2>

<p>The most ancient of such instruments is certainly the
syringe. The Egyptians, says Herodotus (ii., 87), employed
the latter in the embalming of common people, for filling
the belly with oil of cedar, through injections made <i xml:lang="la">per ano</i>,
without opening the body and extracting the intestines.
Heron, in his "Pneumatics," describes an instrument of
this kind, called <i>Pyulgue</i>, which was designed for sucking
pus out of wounds.</p>

<p>The following apparatus, also described by Heron, is the
first step that was taken toward the production of the
pneumatic apparatus properly so called</p>

<p>"<i>Construction of a cupping glass that sucks without the aid
of fire</i>."</p>

<p>Let <i xml:lang="gr">ΑΒΓ</i> (Fig. 1) be a cupping glass (like that which is
usually applied to the skin), divided by a partition, <i xml:lang="gr">ΔΕ</i>.
Through the bottom let there be passed two tubes that slide
one within the other by friction&mdash;<i xml:lang="gr">ΖΗ</i> being the external and
<i xml:lang="gr">ΘΚ</i> the internal one. In these two tubes, external to the
glass, there are two apertures, <i xml:lang="gr">ΛΜ</i>, that face each other.
The extremities of the tubes situated within the apparatus
should be open, and the external extremity of <i xml:lang="gr">ΘΚ</i> should be
closed and provided with a key. Beneath the partition, <i xml:lang="gr">ΔΕ</i>,
there is another cock, <i xml:lang="gr">ΝΞ</i>, like the one just described, save
that the corresponding apertures are within the cupping-glass,
and are in communication with an aperture in the
partition, <i xml:lang="gr">ΔΕ</i>.</p>

<p>"Things being arranged thus, the keys of the cock are
revolved in such a way that the apertures of the one at the
bottom of the instrument are in a line with each other, while
the cock above the partition remains closed, inasmuch as its
apertures do not correspond. The chamber, <i xml:lang="gr">ΔΓ</i>, being full
of air, if we apply the mouth to the orifices, <i xml:lang="gr">ΛΜ</i>, and suck
out a portion of the air, and turn the key of the cock without
removing the mouth from the tube, we shall be able to
thus keep up a rarefaction of the air in the chamber, <i xml:lang="gr">ΓΔ</i>.
The oftener we perform this operation, the more air we shall
remove. Let us now apply the cupping-glass to the skin in
the usual way, and open the cock, <i xml:lang="gr">ΝΞ</i>, by turning the key.
A portion of the air contained in <i xml:lang="gr">ΑΔΕ</i> will pass into <i xml:lang="gr">ΓΔ</i>,
and we shall then see the skin, as well as the subjacent
matters that pass through its interstices, that we call unexplored
spaces, drawn into the space in which the air is rarefied."</p>

<p>As for the pressure fountain, this had reached perfection
as long ago as the Alexandrine epoch. The following
description of it is borrowed from the "Pneumatics:"</p>

<p>"<i>To construct a hollow sphere, or any other vessel, in which,
if a liquid be poured, the latter may be made to rise spontaneously
with great force so as to empty the vessel, although such
motion be contrary to nature</i>."</p>

<p>"The construction is as follows: Let there be a sphere of
a capacity of about six cotyles (about 2¾ pints) made of
some metal tough enough to withstand the pressure of the
air that is to be produced. Let us place this sphere, <i xml:lang="gr">ΑΒ</i>,
upon any base whatever, <i xml:lang="gr">Γ</i>. Through an aperture in its
upper part we introduce a tube which runs down to that
part of the sphere which is diametrically opposite the aperture,
but which leaves sufficient space there for the water to
pass. This tube projects slightly above the sphere, to whose
aperture it is soldered, and divides into two branches, <i xml:lang="gr">Η</i> and
<i xml:lang="gr">Ζ</i>, to which are affixed two bent tubes, <i xml:lang="gr">ΖΜΝΞ</i> and <i xml:lang="gr">ΗΘΚΛ</i>,
that communicate internally with <i xml:lang="gr">Η</i> and <i xml:lang="gr">Ζ</i>. Finally, in
these tubes, <i xml:lang="gr">ΗΘΚΛ</i> and <i xml:lang="gr">ΖΜΝΞ</i>, and in communication with
them, there is adapted another tube, <i xml:lang="gr">ΠΟ</i>, from which issues
at right angles a small tube, <i xml:lang="gr">ΡΣ</i>, that communicates with
it and terminates at <i xml:lang="gr">Σ</i> in a fine orifice.</p>

<p>If, taking the tube, <i xml:lang="gr">ΡΣ</i>, in hand, we revolve the tube,
<i xml:lang="gr">ΠΟ</i>, the two apertures that face each other can no longer establish
a communication, and the liquid that rises will no
longer find an outlet. Then, through another aperture in
the sphere, we insert another tube, <i xml:lang="gr">ΤτΦ</i>, whose lower orifice,
<i xml:lang="gr">Φ</i>, is closed, but which has upon the side, toward the bottom,
at <i xml:lang="gr">Χ</i>, a round hole to which is adapted a small valve of the
sort called by the Romans <i>assarium</i>. Into the tube, <i xml:lang="gr">τΦΤ</i>, we
insert another and closely fitting tube, <i xml:lang="gr">ΨΩ</i>. Let us now
remove the tube, <i xml:lang="gr">ΨΩ</i>, and pour liquid into the tube, <i xml:lang="gr">τΦΤ</i>.
This liquid will enter the cavity of the sphere, through the
aperture, <i xml:lang="gr">Χ</i>. The valve will open in the interior, and the air
will escape through the apertures in the tube, <i xml:lang="gr">ΟΠ</i>, of which
we have already spoken, and which have been so arranged
as to communicate with the tubes, <i xml:lang="gr">ΗΘΚΛ</i> and <i xml:lang="gr">ΖΜΝΞ</i>.
When once the sphere is half full of liquid, we incline the
small tube, <i xml:lang="gr">ΡΣ</i>, so as to shut off all communication between
the corresponding apertures, and then push down the tube,
<i xml:lang="gr">ΨΩ</i>, and drive into the interior of the sphere the air contained
in <i xml:lang="gr">ΤτΦ</i>. This requires some force, as the sphere itself is
full of liquid and air, but the introduction is rendered
possible through the compression of the air, which shrinks
into the empty spaces that it contains within itself. Let us
now take out the tube, <i xml:lang="gr">ΨΩ</i>, again so as to fill the tube, <i xml:lang="gr">ΤτΦ</i>,
with air, and let us push down the tube, <i xml:lang="gr">ΨΦ</i>, again and force
this air into the sphere. On repeating this operation several
times in succession we shall finally have in the sphere a
large quantity of compressed air. It is clear, in fact, that
the air introduced by force cannot escape when the piston-rod
is raised, since the valve, pressed by the internal air,
remains closed. If then, replacing the tube, <i xml:lang="gr">ΡΣ</i>, in a vertical
position, we set up a communication again between the corresponding
apertures, the liquid will be driven to the exterior
through the compressed air, and the latter will assume its
normal volume again, and press in the liquid beneath it. If
the quantity of compressed air is considerable, there will
occur an expulsion, not only of the entire liquid, but also of
the excess of air.</p>

<p>The valve of which I have spoken is constructed as follows
(Fig. 2, 1 <i>bis</i> and 1 <i>ter</i>): Take two pieces of brass about
one inch square, and about as thick as a carpenter's rule, and
rub their surfaces against each other with emery, that is to
say, polish them so that neither air nor liquid can pass
between them. In the middle of one of the pieces bore a
circular aperture about <sup>4</sup>/<sub>10</sub> an inch in diameter. Then
fitting the two plates together by one of their edges, unite
them by a hinge so that the polished surfaces shall coincide
with each other. When this valve is to be made use of, the
part containing the aperture is adapted to the aperture that
is designed for the introduction of the liquid or air that is to
be compressed. The pressure causes the other part of the
valve (which moves easily on its hinge) to open and allow the
liquid or air to enter the tight vessel, wherein it is afterward
confined and presses against the unperforated part of
the valve and thus closes the aperture through which the air
entered."&mdash;<cite>A. de Rochas, in La Nature</cite>.</p>

By <span class="smcap">Alfred L. Carroll, M.D., New Brighton, N. Y.</span></h2>

<p>An editorial comment in <cite>The Medical Record</cite> of April 14th,
upon a paper by Dr. Hamilton, of Philadelphia, may serve as
an apology for some remarks on a subject which ordinarily
seems to possess scarcely more interest for practicing physicians
than for "practical" laymen; both being wont to lay
the finger of incredulity against the nose of scorn when they
turn their deafest ears to the voice of the sanitarian. In the
present very unsettled condition of professional opinion as to
the diagnosis of typhoid fever&mdash;passably good authorities in
India, on Western mountain peaks, and even nearer home,
differing widely thereanent&mdash;I shall not attempt here to discuss
its etiology, or to single out for reprobation any particular
one of the several kinds of bacteria which have been
respectively described as its exclusive cause. Suffice it
merely to hint that there may be possible source of error in
statistical arguments touching its relative frequency in town
or country. But, waiving this, I am not aware that "professed
sanitarians" have ascribed to "sewer-gas" alone such
pre-eminence over other vehicles of filth or fungi as the
article in question imputes. On the contrary, I believe that
the majority of cases of enteric fever which have been traced
accurately to their origin have been traced to other and more
tangible contaminations of food or water. Nevertheless
there is strong evidence, which has stood the test of much
cross examination, that the so-called "filth diseases" deserve
their name in this respect: that whatever be the specific
<i xml:lang="la">tertium quid</i> which determines their occurrence in the
individual, filth-poisoning (<i>i. e.</i>, the imbibition, through some
channel, of the products of organic decomposition) is an
essential factor in their genesis.</p>

<p>The first source of fallacy in the arguments referred to
lies in the misinterpretation of the term "sewer gas," connecting
it with sewers in particular instead of with sewage
in general. Thus, I find it stated that typhoid is "more prevalent
in the suburbs and surrounding country than in the cities
subjected to the contamination of sewer gas;" that diphtheria
and scarlatina occur most fatally "in the country, where
sewer gas is wanting;" and that in Philadelphia the extension
of the sewage system into the rural sections has diminished
the sickness from fever. Now the facts on which most
sanitarians lay great stress are, that unsewered rural districts
are more exposed to danger from fermenting filth than cities,
that the ineffable atrocities of leaching cesspools and privy-vaults
(those perversions of barbarism to which the American
rustic clings as to his most precious birthright) do infinitely
more to poison air, and soil, and water than all the
blunders of city engineers and plumbers combined; and that,
granting the worst that can be said of some city sewers
which shall be nameless, even a bad sewer is better than
none at all&mdash;which is merely equivalent to saying that it is
better to carry away as much of one's sewage as possible
than to keep the whole of it on the premises to decompose
under one's nose. And the peril from this fount and origin
of evil is augmented a hundredfold where the mania for
"modern improvements" has invaded rural households.
Long before sewers are thought of&mdash;even before the importation
of the agonizing pianoforte&mdash;the suburban housewife
insists on having a bath-room, including that sum and substance
of vileness, a pan water-closet on the bedchamber
floor, and a kitchen sink and "stationary tubs" down stairs;
and these fixtures, commonly constructed in the cheapest and
nastiest manner, are connected with an unventilated cesspool,
serving as so many inlets to insure the constant pollution of
the house atmosphere with the gases of decomposition.
Then, in an uncemented basement a "portable furnace" is
arranged to transport to the upper rooms not only the cellar-air,
but the freely indrawn "ground atmosphere," laden
with noxious vapors from the soil-soakage of cesspools or
privies. It is not saying too much to affirm that for every one
channel of filth-poisoning in a paved and sewered city there
are at least three in the average village settlement, and if the
evidence of insanitary conditions be found in "not more
than one house out of five," it is because, unfortunately, very
few physicians in this country have cared to learn how to
look for it&mdash;familiarity with the doses of drugs and the results
of disease being regarded in most of our medical schools
as vastly more important than <i xml:lang="la">rerum cognoscere causas</i>.</p>

<p>I am not sufficiently informed of the morbility statistics
of African cities to appreciate the full weight of reasonings
based upon their alleged comparative salubrity; the occasional
scattered returns which I have seen from a few of them show
death-rates ranging from 30 to over 40 per 1,000. But I am
free to admit, on general principles, that it is less dangerous
to let organic matter decompose fully exposed to atmospheric
oxygen than to store it in unventilated receptacles to form
sulphureted and carbureted compounds, or to saturate an
undrained soil with it. It is to be remembered that few, if
any, sewage substances are suspected of pathogenic power
while in their fresh solid or liquid state: the products of
their subsequent chemical changes are what we have to fear;
and if these products be liberated <i xml:lang="sp">al fresco</i> as fast as they are
formed, they are diluted to hom&oelig;opathic insignificance by the
surrounding air. Of the two evils, therefore, the Africo-Hibernian
practice of throwing house refuse promiscuously
upon the surface is preferable to the American village
method of fostering and festering it in cumulative concentration.</p>

<p>As regards the allegation that "the young men at work in
the fields were more frequently attacked (by typhoid fever)
than the females, who were generally engaged in domestic
duties in or about the house," it may be observed: First,
that agricultural laborers do not spend all their time in the
fields, but sleep in rooms from which, as a class, they carefully
exclude all ventilation; second, that, for some unexplained
reason, enteric fever seems to have a selective affinity
for robust young males. It is an affair of common observation
that, under apparently precisely similar conditions, fragile
women may resist the infection to which strong men
succumb.</p>

<p>Facts, however, are more forcible than words, and I therefore
subjoin a few examples of coincidences which have very
much the air of causes and consequences. I have excluded
instances where water-pollution could be supposed to bear a
part, and also those where careful inquiry did not seem to
eliminate the possibility of immediate or mediate importation
of contagium from a pre-existing case. And let me, at
the outset, deprecate the Liebermeisterian criticism that if
an adynamic fever with peculiar temperature curve, abdominal
symptoms, etc., be not directly traceable to a preceding
patient, it is not true typhoid, but only something otherwise
indistinguishable from it; or that, without evidence of contagion,
a pseudo-membranous angina with grave constitutional
depression is not genuine diphtheria, though a remarkably
good imitation of the real article. Grant only
that there are diseases&mdash;call them what you will&mdash;which
closely resemble the regulation nosological types, that people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6451">6451</span>
sometimes die of them, and that they are intimately associated
with the eating, drinking, or breathing of filth-products,
and I shall, for the present, leave the question of diagnosis
to be begged by whosoever cares for it.</p>

<p>I. <i>Typhoid.</i>&mdash;Large country house with numerous "conveniences."
Two "pan closets" on second floor; one in a
small windowless hall-apartment, the other in a bath-room
adjoining a bed-chamber; basin and bath-wastes led into
trap of water-closet; leaden soil-pipe not continued above the
line of fixtures, communicating directly with cesspool, and
badly corroded at bends of closet-traps. Servants' pan-closet
in basement with foul and leaky "retainer;" kitchen and
laundry wastes on same horizontal branch, constantly liable
to siphonage. Frequent illnesses of minor grade prevailed in
this household until the whole plumbing system was reconstructed
on a proper plan, since when the inmates have enjoyed
excellent health.</p>

<p>II. <i>Typhoid.</i>&mdash;Small house in village street. Under the
cellar runs the ill-covered channel of a former brook, which
receives the sewage of several adjoining tenements. The
house-refuse is discharged into this foul trench through an
open untrapped conduit in the basement.</p>

<p>III. <i>Typhoid.</i>&mdash;Cottage of better class. No plumbing fixtures
except kitchen sink, which discharges untrapped into
an obstructed and very foul drain; leaching privy-pit on
higher ground than the basement, which, with the foundation
walls, is uncemented, affording ingress to ground-atmosphere.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Diphtheria.</i>&mdash;Elegant mansion, regarded by owner
and "practical plumber" as a model of sanitary construction.
Soil-pipe extended above roof, but without ventilation
at its foot. Materials and workmanship good. On a
lateral branch was a down-stairs water-closet into the trap of
which the kitchen waste discharged, and into the dip of the
running-trap of this horizontal soil-pipe, in the basement,
and within a few feet of the furnace, was inserted a servants'
hopper-closet without any flushing fixture; excremental
matter being, of course, thus retained in the trap a great
part of the time, and its decomposition favored by the admixture
of hot water from the kitchen. When the water
from the boiler was set running, the steam arose freely from
this hopper.</p>

<p>V. <i>Diphtheria.</i>&mdash;Handsome country-seat. Plumbing work
recently overhauled and declared perfect by the plumber.
Three foul pan closets and numerous other "conveniences,"
all leading to unventilated cesspool. In the bedroom occupied
by the patient the "safe-waste" from a stationary basin
was carried into the soil-pipe, constituting a direct inlet from
the cesspool.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Diphtheria.</i>&mdash;Presumably "first class" residence.
Kitchen and laundry wastes carried from basement into
privy-vault, which was filled to above the level of the pipes.</p>

<p>VII. <i>Typhoid?</i> (two irregular cases).&mdash;Cottage in good
neighborhood. Bath and basin wastes discharging into trap
of foul pan-closet with "putty-joints." Two inch tin pipe
inserted, with leaky slip-joint, into bend of water closet trap,
and carried with several angles to roof; no other ventilation
of soil-pipe, which connects with leaching cesspool. Cellar
riddled with rat-burrows (indicating probable connection
with some old drain), and airbox of furnace made of loosely
jointed boards, so as to convey the cellar air to upper part
of house.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>Typhoid?</i> (continued fever)&mdash;Cottage on high ground.
Offensive pan-closet on bedroom floor. Soil-pipe relieved by
angular galvanized vent. But carried without other ventilation
or trapping to cesspool on lower ground. Kitchen and
laundry wastes untrapped and led to a row of buried barrels
which were filled with a most malodorous mess, the water
being allowed to soak into the soil as best it might.</p>

<p>IX. <i>Diphtheria.</i>&mdash;House without plumbing fixtures. Cellar
loosely paved with bricks, and saturated with soakage from
several privy-vaults on much higher ground and close in the
rear; the fæcal-smelling semi-liquid filth actually oozing up
between the bricks when they were stepped upon.</p>

<p>X. <i>Diphtheria.</i>&mdash;Cottage alleged by the owner, and innocently
believed by the tenant, to be "one of the best plumbed
houses in the county." Pan closet in a decadent and offensive
condition, with untrapped bath waste and insufficiently
trapped basin waste led into its seal. Short vent from bend
of closet trap to outside of wall, with orifice closed during
winter "to prevent water pipes from freezing;" soil-pipe
thus without ventilation at top or bottom. Butler's pantry
sink connected by tin pipe with earthenware drain, which
was badly laid and composed of different sized pipes. Some
distance beyond the junction of the soil pipe and wastes,
this drain was tapped by a "ventilating" pipe carried into
a chimney flue, with an occasional down-draught. Kitchen
waste opening directly into an unventilated cesspool. All
lead pipes of poorest quality.</p>

<p>XI. <i>Diphtheria.</i>&mdash;Country farm-house. No plumbing.
Uncemented cellar; living room in wing built directly upon
the earth. Overflowing privy-vault within twenty feet and
on higher ground, the soakage and surface washing from
which had permeated the soil around and under the building.</p>

<p>XII. <i>Diphtheria.</i>&mdash;Large and handsome house. Sanitary
arrangements satisfactory to plumber. Pan-closet with insufficient
flush. Two-inch tin vent from bend of soil-pipe
carried with various angles into cold chimney flue. Running
under the whole length of the basement was an eight
inch earthenware drain receiving the soil-pipe and the
wastes from different fixtures; its large caliber and slight
grade precluded proper flushing, and it was thickly coated
with refuse and chilled grease. Into its upper end was inserted
the overflow from a tightly covered cistern, so that
the only ventilation of the entire house-drainage system
was through the rain-water leader, close to a "mansard"
bedroom window.</p>

<p>XIII. <i>Typhoid?</i>&mdash;Two small houses of the poorer class,
situated on a road at the foot of a steep declivity. No
plumbing. Two privy-vaults, a pig-pen, and an indescribably
filthy cow stable just behind and above them, from which
the washings were traceable into their cellars.</p>

<p>I could extend the list by scores of illustrations of rural
house-defects: soil-pipes disjointed from their outlet drains
and discharging their sewage under basement floors; cesspools
"backing-up" into kitchen sinks or laundry tubs, or
pouring a reflux tide through "overflow" pipes into drinking
water cisterns; ingenious devices of every sort to deprive
the gases from pent-up filth of any escape, save into the
dwelling. And these among the "wealthier residents,"
whose surroundings are commonly supposed to be above
suspicion. As regards the unplumbed poor, their chances of
inhaling filth-polluted air or imbibing filth contaminated
water are often enhanced by inadequate cubic space and
faulty construction within doors, and ignorant neglect of the
very rudiments of hygiene in the environment; their cellars
and wells being sunk in soil saturated with putrescent refuse.
In the intermediate agricultural or mechanic class similar
conditions frequently exist, their potency for evil depending
chiefly upon the porous or retentive character of the soil;
precautions to exclude the ground atmosphere from cellars
or basements are seldom found; cesspools and privy-vaults
are close at hand; and it is a common thing for a couple of
adults and two or three children to sleep in a "stuffy" unventilated
room with not more than 1,000 or 1,500 cubic feet
among them.</p>

<p>From a sanitary point of view it matters little whether the
gases from decomposing sewage escape from sodden soil or
from a foul sewer; their nature is alike in either case, and
the aggregate dose may be even larger in the former instance.
But when, and why, and how, they, or any of them,
exert their most deleterious influences, are questions which
it is impossible to answer in the present state of our knowledge.
It is an indisputable fact that people may for a long
while be exposed to them without pronounced manifestations
of "filth disease"&mdash;although such people, in my experience,
are seldom thoroughly well, even if not specifically
ill. But sooner or later an apparent qualitative change
may take place, and an acute zymosis declare itself. I
have elsewhere suggested the part that may be borne
in this complicated problem by a "personal factor," or temporarily
altered individual susceptibility;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> but it seems
necessary also to assume an alteration in the external conditions;
and such alteration is explained by many etiologists
on the hypothesis of the importation or evolution of specific
pathogenic micro-organisms. That certain varieties of schizophytes
are associated with some of the acute infections is
beyond doubt; that in a few, such "microdemes" are the
conveyers,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> if not the causes, of the infection seems proved;
but it must be remembered that in the diseases chiefly under
consideration no characteristic bacteroidal forms have been
defined. In typhoid fever, Klebs describes a bacillus where
Letzerich finds only micrococci; according to Wood and
Formad, the micrococcus of diphtheria is just like that of
the ordinary buccal mucus; indeed, nearly all of the acutest
infectious diseases are attributed to these ubiquitous micrococci,
indistinguishable from each other in most instances,
and divided into species solely on the score of their assumed
physiological effects. Admitting all that the most ardent
advocates of the germ theory can claim for it, there are at
least three possible ways in which filth and fungi may be
connected.</p>

<p>1. Taking the view of Naegeli and others as regards the
mutability of the bacteria, it is conceivable that the common
"scavenger" microphytes may acquire pathogenic properties
by successive generations of development amid the products
of certain decomposing substances. In favor of this
conception may be cited the seemingly gradual intensification
of "filth poisoning" in numerous instances; sore throats
of a less septic type forerunning outbreaks of diphtheria;
diarrh&oelig;al derangements preceding enteric fever; and, furthermore,
Koch has found both bacillus-spores and micrococci
in surface soils, the latter organisms preponderating
where the earth is subjected to excremental soakage.</p>

<p>2. Or, accepting the specific classification of the schizomycetes,
it may be supposed that some pathogenic germs
obtain favorable intermediate conditions for their development
and multiplication in these products of decomposition;
a supposition almost necessary if the specific-germ theory
be applied to enteric or choleraic discharges.</p>

<p>3. Finally, if it be conceded that desiccated spores may
retain their specific vitality indefinitely, and be air-wafted
almost unboundedly, the predisposing action of our filth
emanations maybe imagined to be cumulative, slowly undermining
the individual powers of resistance, or rendering
certain cell groups an easier prey to the intruding organisms
in the struggle for existence.</p>

<p>Which of these hypotheses, if either of them, will ultimately
prevail is a question only to be decided by experimental
investigations which are beset by a multitude of difficulties
and sources of error.&mdash;<cite>Med. Record</cite>.</p>

<h2 id="HORSE_MEDICINE_BIT">HORSE MEDICINE BIT.</h2>

<p>Owing, no doubt, to the preponderance of horizontality
over verticality in the construction of the horse, there results
a considerable difficulty in administering medicine to
that quadruped, and he frequently has to undergo what
may be said to amount to cruelty in the endeavor to persuade
him to swallow the unpalatable dose. It is therefore
with satisfaction that we bring under our readers'
notice a simple and effective invention which promises to
do away with this difficulty, and from humanitarian motives
we hope to see it widely adopted. It is the joint production
of Mr. Philip Fonnereau, of Masons' Arms Yard,
Maddox Street, and Mr. Willoughby Fielding, of Lisle
Street, Leicester Square, London. The inventors have
adopted the sensible and very obvious plan of utilizing that
which the horse is trained to tolerate&mdash;viz., the bit. It will
be seen from the annexed engravings that the invention
consists essentially of a tubular bit, with a funnel attached,
as shown at Fig. 1. The bit has a hole, which is close to
the horse's tongue when in its mouth. The upper part of
the apparatus is fitted with a rope, which is passed through
a ring in the ceiling of the stable. By this rope the horse's
head is gently elevated, so as to prevent the medicine from
going in any other direction than down its throat. When
it has been properly adjusted, as shown at Fig. 2, the medicine
is poured into the funnel, and it immediately runs
through the hole into the horse's mouth, and the animal
cannot help swallowing it. The apparatus is then removed,
and rinsed out for future use. Of course the invention is
adapted to liquid medicine only, but we believe it is as easy
to prepare medicine in a liquid form as in any other, and
therefore there need be no difficulty on that account. We
commend this invention to all having the care of horses as a
practical means of obviating the perpetuation of a hitherto
necessary but now unnecessary cruelty to animals.&mdash;<cite>Iron.</cite></p>

<h2 id="THE_PHYSIOLOGY_OF_SLEEP">THE PHYSIOLOGY OF SLEEP.</h2>

<p>As regards the vascular condition of the cerebrum during
natural sleep, there seems to be at present a virtual agreement
among physiologists. Whatever views may be held
of the immediate or proximate cause, it is generally admitted
that during sleep the brain is relatively anæmic. There
are well-attested facts enough on record to substantiate this.
The brain, denuded of a portion of its cranial covering, has
been carefully watched during the waking state and in sleep,
and it has been ascertained that, both in man and in the
lower animals, the organ is comparatively bloodless during
sleep, and its circulation more sluggish than at other
times.</p>

<p>In the early part of this century Blumenthal first enunciated
this theory, and supported it by the interesting case of
a patient who had lost a portion of the right frontal bone;
during sleep the brain was seen to be anæmic and in a collapsed
condition. Dendy<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> relates a similar case, which was
observed in 1821. But Durham's memoir on the physiology
of sleep, which was published in the volume of "Guy's
Hospital Reports" for 1860, was the first really thorough and
scientific contribution to our knowledge of the vascular
state of the encephalon during sleep, and the relation of
that state to the phenomena of sleep. To Hammond also,
many of whose experiments were made prior to Durham's
publication, we are indebted for numerous original observations,
and for the most exhaustive and conclusive exposition
of the subject yet given to the world.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>We may see that during sleep all the encephalic blood-vessels
are under a diminished pressure, as proved in fact
by the manometer, and that this lessening of the active flow
corresponds with a diminution of cerebral function. Even
if no experiments had ever been made, inductive reasoning
would have led irresistibly to this conclusion. During the
intervals of digestion the gastric mucous membrane is relatively
pale and bloodless; the submaxillary gland does not
become turgid with blood until it begins to secrete saliva;
a muscle in action becomes markedly hyperæmic. It is so
with the organs in general. The performance of function
is characterized by vascular activity and fullness. If in any
part there is a call for work, there is a call for more blood.
The nervous system forms no exception to this law, and
there is the most intimate and absolute correlation between
the evolution of nervous energy and the activity of the circulation.
So true is this that it is everywhere admitted that
the induction of functional work in any such apparatus as
the digestive, the sexual, or the muscular produces a degree
of hyperæmia of the apparatus called into action sufficient
to prove a serious hinderance to the easy and satisfactory
performance of any severe mental task.</p>

<p>Professor Mosso, of Turin, has lately made some interesting
experiments on persons who had lost portions of the
cranial bones, using Marey's ingenious hydro-sphygmograph.
Noting, like others before him, that during sleep
the brain diminished in volume, with shrinkage of its blood-vessels,
and that the lively blush characterizing its surface
during the waking state disappeared, he observed also that
any sudden impression, if sufficient to rouse the brain to
partial activity, was sure to be attended with an increase of
its vascularity and its volume. He has proved, too, that
every effort of the intellect is normally accompanied by a
diminution of volume in the peripheral parts, the arm, for
example, and that, on the contrary, when the cerebral activity
is lessened the distant members are augmented in
volume. Sleep is always accompanied by a dilatation of the
vessels of the extremities, and particularly of the forearm,
where this dilatation has repeatedly been measured by Mosso
with his registering apparatus. Every excitation from without
causes a contraction of the vessels of the forearm of the
sleeping subject, and the augmented blood pressure at once
produces a renewed afflux of blood to the brain. In this
manner the fluctuations of cerebral activity can be followed:
a sound, a touch, a ray of light falling on the closed lid of
the sleeper, all give rise to modifications of the cerebral
circulation&mdash;unperceived, doubtless, but possibly the source
of dreams.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>The immediate cause of sleep is not simply the shutting off
of a portion of the blood current from the brain. There are
more important factors. Here Vulpian<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> is right. The lessening
of the blood supply to the encephalon is rather the
accompaniment than the cause of sleep. We cannot produce
normal sleep in a person simply by exsanguinating
his brain, or else we should have in an ice-cap and a hot
foot-bath the speediest and most effective of hypnotics.
The brain must first be in a certain condition. There must
be in the constitution of the supreme nerve centers something
that forbids further activity, and with that cessation
of activity there will be a lessening of the blood-flow to the
brain, in accordance with the physiological law before
stated. What is the particular modification of the cortical
cells which renders them less fit for the liberation of their
special forces, and finally compels a suspension of action,
with a diminution of the blood supply? Herbert Spencer
has given a very plausible explanation, in accordance with
the theory of evolution:</p>

<p>The waste of the nerve-centers having become such that
the stimuli received from the external world no longer suffice
to call forth from them adequate discharges, there results
a diminished impulse to those internal organs which
subserve nervous activity, including more especially the
heart. Consequently, the nerve-centers, already working
feebly, are supplied with less blood and begin to work more
feebly, responding still less to impressions, and discharge
still less to the heart. And so the two act and react until
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6452">6452</span>
there is reached a state of profound unimpressibility and inactivity.
Between this state and the waking state the
essential distinction is great reduction of waste, which falls
so low that the rate of repair exceeds it.... During the
day the loss is greater than the gain, whereas during the
night the gain is diminished by scarcely any loss. Hence results
accumulation; there is restoration of nerve-tissue to its
state of integrity.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Spencer, that rhythmical variation in
nervous activity which we see in sleep and waking is the
result of adaptation, due to survival of the fittest. "An
animal so constituted that waste and repair were balanced
from moment to moment throughout the twenty-four hours
would, other things equal, be overcome by an enemy or
competitor that could evolve greater energy during the
hours when light facilitates action, at the expense of being
less energetic during the hours of darkness and concealment."<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>With some qualification, the foregoing statement is about
as satisfactory as any that has yet been offered as to the
proximate cause of sleep. During the waking hours the
vaso-motor center in the medulla is doubtless under inhibition
by the superior centers, and there is relative relaxation
of the cerebral arterioles, with dilatation of the capillaries;
when the cells of the hemispheres are exhausted, they are no
longer able to exercise this inhibition&mdash;in common parlance,
they no longer powerfully extract the blood&mdash;and the vaso-motor
center "puts on the brakes"; the blood supply is
then no longer sufficient for function, though enough for
nutrition.</p>

<p>An ingenious theory has lately been proposed by Preyer,
of Jena,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> according to which, to use a homely illustration,
the fire ceases to burn because the flues are clogged with
cinders.</p>

<p>As Preyer puts it, the activity of the cerebrum is a sort
of respiration, while its repose is a sort of asphyxia of this
organ. It is certain that every psychical act, every thought,
involves a certain consumption of oxygen by the nervous
substance. During waking, this gas is furnished to the
brain in the blood. If the blood supply fails, those forms
of activity which we denominate consciousness, attention,
volition, and thought cease. This is easily proved by compression
of the carotids. It is known that in the waking
hours the muscles, as well as the nerves and the nerve-centers,
as a consequence of that activity, produce substances
easily oxidizable, among which is lactic acid. Some have
even attributed the sense of fatigue which we experience
after prolonged exertion to the presence of this acid in the
blood.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> According to Preyer, after the work of the day is
done, and the quiet of sleep is sought, the waste materials
of which we have spoken, and which he proposes to call
<i xml:lang="fr">ponogènes</i> (substances which cause fatigue), being accumulated
in the tissues, little by little undergo decomposition,
by taking oxygen from the blood. They thus divert a considerable
quantity of this gas from the cerebrum, the cells
of which, deprived of this element so indispensable to their
activity, enter into a state of relative repose. These waste
matters are, then, the physical cause of sleep, which will
be the more profound and prolonged the more the blood is
charged with the excrementitious products of function.
Preyer has experimented on animals by injecting varying
quantities of lactic acid into their blood, and has produced
a deep somnolent condition which could not be distinguished
from natural sleep. The use of lactate of sodium in the
human subject has sometimes been attended with a like
hypnotic effect. Further researches are needed before the
question can be considered as settled.&mdash;<cite>N. Y. Med. Jour.</cite></p>

<h2 id="PREPARATION_OF_CHLORHYDRINES">PREPARATION OF CHLORHYDRINES.</h2>

<p>The usual methods of preparing chlorhydrines are in part
inconvenient, in part unsatisfactory in yield. A. Ladenburg
therefore proposes the following process, using ethylen-chlorhydrine
as an example:</p>

<p>Glycol is heated in a distillery apparatus to 148° C., and a
<i>slow</i> current of dry hydrochloric acid passed through it.
The water formed and the glycol-chlorhydrine distill over
and are collected in tubulated receivers. The temperature
of the bath is gradually raised to 160° C., when all the glycol
is completely decomposed, except a trifling residue. The

<h2 id="A_NEW_METHOD_FOR_THE_DETECTION_OF_SUGAR_IN_THE_URINE">A NEW METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF SUGAR IN THE URINE.</h2>

<p>At a recent meeting of the Clinical Society of London,
Dr. Oliver gave a demonstration of the method he employs
for the detection of sugar in the urine by means of test-papers.
The test-papers were charged with the carmine of
indigo and carbonate of soda. When one was dropped into
an ordinary half inch test tube, and as much water poured
in as just covered the upper end, and heat applied, a transparent
and true blue solution, resembling Fehling's in appearance,
was obtained. (A transparent solution could not,
at the meeting, be produced from the London water. The
characteristic reaction with grape sugar was, however, unimpaired).</p>

<p>If with the paper one drop of diabetic urine had been
added, shortly after the first simmer, a beautiful series of
color changes appeared; first violet, then purple, then red,
and finally straw color; while, on the other hand, one drop
of non-diabetic urine induced no alteration of color. The
colors returned in the inverse order on shaking the tube,
which allowed the air to mingle with the liquid. Reheating
restored the colors again.</p>

<p>Confirmation of the presence of glucose was obtained by
dropping in a mercuric chloride paper, while the solution
was still quite hot, after the complete development of the
indigo reaction. Then there was produced immediately a
blackish green precipitate. No such precipitation occurred
when a drop of non-saccharine urine was under examination
by the indigo test; then the blue solution was merely turned
into a transparent green one.</p>

<p>This test, as Dr. Oliver pointed out, discovers (<i>a</i>) the normal
sugar; (<i>b</i>) the varying proportions of sugar which fill in
the gap between the normal amount and that which characterizes
diabetes mellitus, as in liver derangements and vaso-motor
disturbances; (<i>c</i>) diabetic proportions.</p>

<p>It possesses the following advantages over Fehling's test:</p>

<p>1. It will detect sugar in any proportion in the presence
of albumen, peptone, blood, pus, or bile, and as readily as
in ordinary diabetic urine.</p>

<p>2. It gives no play of colors with uric acid.</p>

<p>3. It possesses portability, cleanliness, and stability.</p>

<p>Moore's, Trommer's, and Boettger's bismuth tests are all
inferior in delicacy.&mdash;<cite>British Medical Journal.</cite></p>

<h2 id="CHEMICAL_COMPOUNDS_MADE_BY_COMPRESSION">CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS MADE BY COMPRESSION.<br />

<small>By M. W. <span class="smcap">Spring</span></small>.</h2>

<p>The author has previously shown the possibility of uniting
the fragments of solid bodies by the sole action of pressure.
He also established at the same time the possibility of forming
chemical compounds by means of pressure. Thus he
obtained cuprous sulphide by compressing a mixture of sulphur
dust and copper; mercuric iodide, by compressing
mercuric chloride with potassium iodide, etc. Finally, by
compressing in the same manner mixtures of the filings of
different metals, he formed alloys having for equal compositions
the same melting points as those obtained by fusion.</p>

<p>The last mentioned facts certainly establish the possibility
of causing bodies to enter into chemical reaction by the mere
agency of a mechanical energy. This result is closely linked
with another obtained during the course of the same investigation:
the polymerization of certain simple bodies, <i>e. g.</i>, sulphur,
by the action of pressure. The author had drawn a
general conclusion from his experiments, and had announced
that matter takes, below a given temperature, a state corresponding
to the volume which it is compelled to occupy.</p>

<p>He has since undertaken a methodical study of the chemical
reactions accomplished by the action of pressure. He had
already shown the possibility of forming metallic arsenides
by compressing mixtures of arsenic and of the filings of
different metals (<i xml:lang="fr">Bulletin de l'Académie Royale de Belgique</i>, t.
v., 1883), and he now communicates the results obtained by
compressing mixtures of sulphur and of certain metals or
non-metals. The results not merely confirm the author's
former conclusions, but they throw a new light on the relations
of organic and inorganic chemistry, and exhibit the so-called
simple bodies as capable of assuming a peculiar constitution
varying according to the conditions in which they
are placed, and the actions to which they are submitted.</p>

<p>He used the metals in the state of fine filings immediately
mixed with flowers of sulphur previously thoroughly washed.
The mixtures were made in atomic proportions and were
submitted to a preliminary pressure of 6,500 atmospheres.
They then assumed the state of a hard compact mass, showing,
on examination with the microscope, that the reaction
of the sulphur and the metal had taken place wherever the
elements were in contact. The mass obtained was then reduced
into fine powder and compressed again from twice to
eight times.</p>

<p>1. <i>Sulphur and Magnesium.</i>&mdash;After six compressions there
was obtained a gray mass with a feebly metallic surface
luster. It dissolves in water at 50° to 60° with a slow escape
of hydrogen sulphide, the liquid becoming of a golden yellow.
A drop of hydrochloric acid occasions immediately a
very strong escape of hydrogen sulphide, while free sulphur
is deposited. Hence magnesium and sulphur combine under
the action of pressure, forming magnesium sulphide and
possibly a polysulphide.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sulphur and Zinc.</i>&mdash;Three compressions yield a block
deceptively similar to native blende with metallic luster.
Dilute sulphuric acid dissolves the block slowly with an
escape of hydrogen sulphide.</p>

<p>3. <i>Sulphur and Iron.</i>&mdash;After four compressions a block is
obtained which the file scarcely touches. Dilute sulphuric
acid dissolves it easily with continuous escape of hydrogen
sulphide. If the product of compression is heated in a
closed tube no luminous phenomenon is observed, the body
entering into tranquil fusion. Hence the potential heat of
the free sulphur and iron has been realized during the compression.</p>

<p>4. <i>Sulphur and Cadmium.</i>&mdash;Three compressions give a yellowish-gray
homogeneous mass. The powder is yellow, but
less pure than that of cadmium sulphide obtained by precipitation.
Strong hydrochloric acid dissolves the mass with
escape of hydrogen sulphide.</p>

<p>5. <i>Sulphur and Aluminum.</i>&mdash;Result incomplete. After
five compressions a mass is obtained which, in contact with
moist air, gives off an odor of hydrogen polysulphide.</p>

<p>6. <i>Sulphur and Bismuth.</i>&mdash;The combination takes place
with great ease.</p>

<p>7. <i>Sulphur and Lead.</i>&mdash;The combination is still more easy.</p>

<p>8. <i>Sulphur and Silver.</i>&mdash;The action is slow; eight compressions
are necessary.</p>

<p>9. <i>Sulphur and Copper.</i>&mdash;Three compressions complete the
combination. When the product of the compression is heated,
there is no development of heat or light.</p>

<p>10. <i>Sulphur and Tin.</i>&mdash;Three compressions give a block
which yields a yellowish-gray powder, easily soluble in a hot
solution of sodium sulphide. Stannic sulphide is therefore
formed by the compression of sulphur and tin.</p>

<p>11. <i>Sulphur and Antimony.</i>&mdash;After two compressions we
obtain a gray-black mass having the color and luster of stibine.
When powdered it dissolves with ease in hot hydrochloric
acid, giving off hydrogen sulphide.</p>

<p>12. <i>Sulphur and Red Phosphorus; Sulphur and Carbon.</i>&mdash;Result
entirely <i>nil</i>; there is produced not the least trace of
phosphorus sulphide nor of carbon sulphide.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSIONS TO BE DRAWN FROM THESE FACTS.</h3>

<p>The negative results just mentioned have an especial interest.
It is established that red phosphorus has a higher specific
gravity than white phosphorus, that of the former
being 1.96, and that of the latter 1.82. The author's former
researches (<i xml:lang="fr">Bulletins de l'Académie Royale de Belgique</i>, 49, p.
323, 1880) have shown that if sufficient pressure is applied to
a body capable of assuming several allotropic states, it takes
under pressure the state corresponding to its greatest density.
It is consequently impossible to transform red phosphorus
into white phosphorus by pressure. But we know, on the
other hand, that red sulphur and red phosphorus may be
mixed with impunity at common temperatures without combination
ensuing; to produce combination the temperature
must be raised to about 260°, the point of transformation of
red phosphorus into white phosphorus.</p>

<p>It is thus established that red phosphorus must first be
changed from its allotropic condition before entering into
combination with sulphur. The pressure opposing this
change renders also the act of combination impossible; red
phosphorus appears to us like a body which has lost its chemical
faculties.</p>

<p>Thus, the combination of an element with itself, <i>i. e.</i>, its
polymerization, has really the effect of extinguishing its
energy, rendering it incapable of fulfilling certain functions.
The chemistry of red phosphorus, more simple than that of
white phosphorus, may be considered as the chemistry of a
deadened body. The phosphorus which is found in combination
with sulphur is phosphorus sulphides, and that
which enters into combinations of other kinds, is certainly
not phosphorus in the red state; it is even possible, if not
probable, that it is not even white phosphorus, but a substance
still unknown in the free state.</p>

<p>We arrive at a similar but more complete conclusion as to
the nature of carbon. It is known that the affinity of carbon
for sulphur and even for oxygen only becomes manifest
at a temperature bordering upon redness. Is not this tantamount
to saying that, in order to enter into combination
with another body, carbon, like red phosphorus, must first
change its allotropic condition? This view is supported by
the following considerations: The specific heat of amorphous
carbon, and, <i xml:lang="la">a fortiori</i>, that of graphite and diamond, form
exceptions to the law of Dulong and Petit; they are too
small by more than one-half. They would be normal if the
atomic weight of carbon were greater than it really is; in
other words, free carbon were a polymer of combined carbon.
Rose has found that at a temperature of about 500° the specific
heat of carbon agrees with the law of Dulong and Petit.
At this temperature carbon undergoes a beginning of depolymerization,
<i>i. e.</i>, its chemical affinities reappear, and it burns
readily in oxygen. Do not these facts show a complete
parallelism between the chemical history of phosphorus and
that of carbon?</p>

<p>Crystalline carbon, and even free amorphous carbon, are
without chemical activity at the ordinary temperature; but
when, in consequence of a rise of temperature, they take
another state, they are transformed into a new kind of carbon,
constituting a fourth allotropic state, and endowed with
a prodigious capacity of combination. If these conclusions
are well founded, we may venture a step further and ask, if
the carbon which enters into the composition, not of mere
organic compounds, but of organized bodies, is not a carbon
of still another allotropic state characterized by the appearance
of new properties or forms of combination which find
their expression in the vital phenomena.</p>

<p>In other words, a derivative of carbon, before forming
part of a living body, must first undergo in its atoms a
transformation similar to that which permits amorphous
carbon to enter into the composition of organic compounds.
In this order of ideas the carbon of organic chemistry would
be merely a first deadened form of the carbon of biological
chemistry, while free carbon is merely the defunct remains
of the carbon of organic chemistry.&mdash;<i xml:lang="fr">Bulletin de la Société

<h2 id="COPPER_ALLOYS_AMONG_THE_ANCIENTS">COPPER ALLOYS AMONG THE ANCIENTS.<br />

<small>By Prof. <span class="smcap">E. Reyer, Ph.D.</span>, of Vienna</small>.</h2>

<p>The earth's crust consists in part of eruptive rocks, in
part of sedimentary rocks. Both of them have served from
time immemorial for building purposes; but at a very early
period they were the only source from which weapons and
tools could be made. Subsequently metals became known,
and were employed for this purpose.</p>

<p>Metals are rarely met with in a pure state, but generally
in combination with oxygen or sulphur. If we examine the
original material of which the earth was composed, and
which is frequently injected through crevices in the earth's
crust, and the superjacent sediment as eruptive rock, we
find it to be a mixture of different substances of a complex
nature. It contains silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, magnesium,
potassium, and sodium. None of these are in a
free state, but are combined with oxygen. Silicon, the
lighter metals, and heavy iron do not exhibit their true metallic
character, having all been changed into stone-like
compounds, "calcified by contact with vital air," as the
old chemists expressed it.</p>

<p>Of the heavy metals that are of such importance to civilization
I have only mentioned iron, for this alone, in its
compounds, takes any considerable part in the rock formations.
Other heavy metals are met with in smaller quantities
in the rocks. They are scarcely taken into account by
geologists who consider the earth as a whole, but it is these
rare guests that are of the greatest importance to civilization.</p>

<p>The metals are met with as silicates in the eruptive
masses; they are also found as oxides or sulphides, scattered
through different eruptive rocks in small granules.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Besides
these, the "ores," which are workable metallic compounds,
are here and there concentrated in crevices or fissures,
which exist in eruptive as well as in sedimentary
rocks.</p>

<p><i>Iron</i> is met with as oxide in the eruptive rocks, in fissures,
and finally in thick strata and deposits within the sediment;
whole mountains consist of iron ore.</p>

<p><i>Tin</i> occurs as oxide (tin stone), scattered through eruptive
masses rich in quartz, also in fissures.</p>

<p><i>Copper</i>, combined with sulphur, is found distributed
through dark eruptive rocks, poor in silica, and also in fissures
in those regions.</p>

<p><i>Gold</i> and <i>silver</i> are mixed in smaller quantities with ores of
other metals.</p>

<p>All these are continually exposed to atmospheric agencies
toward which they act very differently. The oxidized ores
of iron and tin do not change their character. The sulphur
compounds, at least when near the surface, are oxidized,
and hand in hand with this process goes the partial reduction
of certain metals to the metallic state. Gold and silver,
and to a less extent copper, are subject to this change; they
are unmasked and are exposed to day light, not as stones,
but as brilliant, malleable metals. Finally, the heavy ores
and metallic particles are loosened from the rocks by the destructive
action of water, floated off, elutriated, and
washed. In undisturbed mountain ranges the mineral
treasures lie in masses before our eyes.</p>

<p>The native shining and malleable metals (gold, silver, and
copper) naturally first attracted the attention of man. They
may have used the separate nuggets for ornaments as they
found them, or after hammering them together into plates.
This was surely the first step in the use of metals. It can
scarcely be supposed that this use of soft native metals contributed
much to the progress of mankind, and it is highly
probable that in those early times the noble metal had but
little value. The shining particles, as long as the natural
supply lasted, seemed like worthless tinsel. Copper,
which can be made into tools and vessels, as well as soft,
poor weapons, was more highly prized. Such materials
were not, indeed, suitable and able to take the place of
stone tools and weapons; nevertheless, this working of
metals served as preparation for the more complicated work
of later times. Man learned to hammer and shape metals,
and he found out that the operation was much facilitated
by heating the metal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6453">6453</span></p>

<p>The discovery of iron meteorites may have had some
value. In these the smith first became acquainted with the
properties of a hard metal. But I would not attach too
much importance to this. The art of working metals is not
the possession of a people that have a few meteoric knives.
In my opinion the metallurgical preparation of the hard
metals from their ores is alone decisive on this point.</p>

<p>The volks' sagas frequently mention some god or hero,
who discovered and taught metallurgy, yet there is scarcely
any doubt that the "god," in most cases, was human ingenuity
led by chance.</p>

<p>We have already seen that only certain metals are found
native, while the hard metals under normal conditions remain
in the form of oxide or mineral. They have a strong
affinity for the oxygen of the air, and can only be separated
and converted into metals by powerful chemical agents.
There is <i>one</i> substance which has a still more powerful attraction
for oxygen than those metals. This is ignited carbon,
which, in its fight with the metallic oxides, robs them
of their oxygen.</p>

<p>Carbon has been separated from the carbonic acid of the
air by the life-giving force of the sun, and vegetable life dependent
upon it. But the isolated element waits impatiently
for the impulse that will enable it to unite with the
vital air under flame and heat. Men that know how to
utilize this process of nature possess the means of resurrecting
those metallic treasures which, without its powerful assistance,
would remain forever hidden from their eyes.
But accident, as we have said, pointed out the way.</p>

<p>In numerous places visited by primeval man, as hunter
and fisherman, and afterward as nomad, conflagrations
broke out. Not unfrequently whole forests were burned,
either intentionally or not. It could not be otherwise than
that the earth's surface would get red hot in such places,
and if a strong wind favored it, this would suffice to open
these treasures. The glowing charcoal would rob the ores
of their oxygen and leave the pure metal as melted drops or
cakes.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Copper, tin, and iron ores could have been reduced
in this way; mankind not only knew the result but
also the method of reducing metals.</p>

<p>This process took place not once merely, but thousands of
times in various parts of the earth, and thus, in my opinion,
metallurgy may have become known to different races of
people and at different times.</p>

<p>A simple trench in the ground, in which a heap of glowing
coals and some pieces of ore could be subjected to a
strong draught of air, suffices, under favorable circumstances,
for the preparation of the metal; the oldest metallurgists
had scarcely any more complete means at hand for
their work.</p>

<p>In such primitive furnaces the well known and soft metals
would naturally be worked first, and afterward copper, tin,
and iron would be obtained from their ores. A variety of
substances that occur together in nature would be smelted
together in mixtures, and different metals would naturally
be mixed and a great variety of products obtained.</p>

<h3 id="coca">CHARACTERISTICS OF COPPER ALLOYS.</h3>

<p>The oldest civilized races used bronze for a long space of
time as their chief useful metal, although some neighboring
races understood the metallurgy of iron. These facts, which
are in glaring contradiction to the present condition of
things, require some explanation.</p>

<p>First it must be mentioned that <i>iron</i> frequently contains
injurious contaminations, sulphur, phosphorus, etc., and
that it must have been very difficult for these primitive metallurgists
to remove these contaminations, and to introduce
the proper quantity of carbon into the iron. We must also
consider that even a good, pure steel would be a useless product
unless it was worked by a skillful and experienced
smith. Finally, iron is much more rapidly destroyed by
oxidation than bronze. These negative considerations certainly
favored the rule of bronze for a long time.</p>

<p>The following facts must be fixed in mind regarding the
manufacture of bronze in olden times:</p>

<p>1. In many districts copper and tin ores are found near
together (as in Cornwall), so that under these circumstances
bronze could have been obtained by smelting both at once,
and together.</p>

<p>2. In olden times only the upper horizon of copper deposits
were worked in all districts. In these, as we know,
the ores are mostly oxides (with native copper). Such ores
are easily worked and yield largely.</p>

<p>3. In regard to the mixing of metals, the metallurgists
everywhere must have soon learned by experience that the
metal remained soft and red when too little tin was added,
while too much tin made it light colored and lustrous, but,
at the same time, very brittle. Hence, we find that among
all peoples the alloys used for weapons contain from 6 to 16,
or, more closely, 8 to 12 per cent. of tin. These mixtures
have been found to do the best.</p>

<p>4. Bronzes, as we shall see below, by slight admixtures
and certain treatment, can be made so tough and hard that
they will compare with moderately hard steel.</p>

<p>So we see: The metal was useful, and there was an excess
of rich and easily worked ores. Under such conditions, of
course, the age of bronze would flourish a long time.</p>

<p>Zinc ores frequently occur on copper beds, and yet zinc
is rarely found in quantity worth mentioning in the bronzes
of the ancients. There are two reasons for this:</p>

<p>1. Near the surface of the earth zinc occurs as calamine
(silicate of zinc), which is a gray, unattractive, earthy looking
mineral, not heavy enough to be taken for a metallic
ore, and would naturally be thrown away and not put in
the furnace.</p>

<p>2. If some zinc ore did get into the furnace, part of it
would be volatilized and part oxidized by subsequent
smelting.</p>

<p>In later times, however, we find zinc ores used a good
deal. We can distinguish three types of zinc alloys:</p>

<p>1. Copper with 10 to 20 per cent. zinc produces a red
metal, red brass, which is similar to bronze that is poor in
tin.</p>

<p>2. Copper with 20 or 30 (and even 40) per cent. of zinc,
gives a yellow metal (yellow or ordinary brass), which has
more of a golden color than bronze with much tin, but
quite brittle.</p>

<p>3. Statuary metal, which is made of copper with quite a
good deal of zinc and little tin (often lead) can be called
brass containing tin.</p>

<p>All three types may be used for casting (ornaments,
statues, and coin), but are not useful for tools or weapons,
because they have not sufficient strength.</p>

<p>After discussing the natural association of ores, and the
most important alloys of copper, we will turn to the analyses
of antique alloys. I have found it necessary to divide them
into two groups:</p>

<p>1. Alloys from which the weapons and tools were <i>forged</i>.
These are pure and genuine bronzes. I shall designate them
as malleable metals or weapon bronzes.</p>

<p>2. Alloys from which ornaments, vessels, statues, and
coin were <i>cast</i>. Some of these contain lead, some zinc, and
some are varieties of our brass. I shall designate these as
cast metals or ornamental alloys. Those substances present
in some quantity were evidently put in <i>intentionally</i>, and I
have classed them as admixtures, while the unintentional
ones in small quantities I have designated as impurities.</p>

<p>The following general statements are based upon these
tables:</p>

<p>We see that the peoples named forged their weapons and
tools from very different alloys; pure copper at one extreme,
bronze with 20 per cent. tin at the other. Experience
had everywhere taught them that copper and bronzes poor
in tin are too soft, while bronzes with an excess of tin could
not be used for weapons and tools on account of being too
brittle.</p>

<p>They had also learned that lead and zinc considerably
lessened the strength and tenacity of weapon bronze, while
small quantities of iron, nickel, and cobalt are, at least, not
injurious. So all races, although we can prove that they
tried very different mixtures, finally adopted very simple
and tolerably constant alloys. The bronze weapons of all
countries frequently contain from 6 to 16 per cent. of tin,
but usually between 8 and 12, with slight contamination of
iron and nickel. Few nations have allowed lead to be used,
fewer yet some zinc.</p>

<p>For casting, the oldest races used the same kind of bronze
as for weapons and tools. In many cases a few per cent. of
lead were added to make the casting easier. The Romans
used zinc in addition to lead in large quantity as a constituent
of their alloys, and they made old bronze, bronze-brass, and
brass. Afterward many nations of middle Europe used
zinc alloys.</p>

<p>Small quantities of iron, nickel, and cobalt are found for
well known reasons in nearly all bronzes as harmless impurities.</p>

<p>Traces of <i>sulphur</i> are also found in them. This injures
the quality of the alloy, and discloses the fact that such
bronzes were not made from pure oxide ores, but from those
containing sulphur pyrites. At the time when such bronzes
were produced the mines had probably reached a considerable
depth.</p>

<p>Some of the weapon bronzes made by the ancients contain
traces of <i>phosphorus</i>, an element as important in hard
bronze as carbon is in steel.</p>

<h3 id="cta">CASTING THE ALLOYS.</h3>

<p>The Semito-Hamitic races made excellent castings at a
very early date. The Ph&oelig;nicians may be mentioned as
particularly skillful. It is reported that there were two
immense bronze pillars that stood before the temple of
Gades in the 11th century before Christ. The Tyrian
founders also made a pillar for Solomon's Temple, and a
metallic basin 10 ells in diameter and 5 deep. Similar
large basins have been dug up in Assyria.</p>

<p>The art of casting statues is no less ancient. Small statuettes
were cast solid; larger ones consisted of several pieces
which were riveted together. In the later Grecian and old
Roman days the art reached a high stage of perfection.
Many cities had thousands of bronzes; gigantic pieces were
constructed. The Colossus of Rhodes was 30 meters high
and stood with outstretched legs astride the entrance to the
smaller harbor. Ships could pass through it with sails extended.
A statue of Jupiter in Tarent was 20 meters high,
and one of Nero was erected in Pliny's time, 30 meters high,
costing a million dollars.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>These facts give us a good idea of the technical ability of
the old founders of bronze.</p>

<p>Analyses of antique bronzes give us some idea of their art
of mixing and coloring. We presume that they soon abandoned
the use of copper and pure bronze; the former yields
porous casts and of a poor color; the latter material was, in
later times, too costly. Lead was probably used at first for
its fusibility only, but afterward it was certainly introduced
for economical reasons. This cheap material was often
added in very considerable quantity until they learned that
leaden bronzes did not have a fine color either while fresh
and clean, or when old and covered with patina.</p>

<p>We have also seen that zinc, as well as lead, was often
added. As the color of zinc alloys was red to light golden
yellow (red metal, brass), they tried to dispense with tin entirely,
as its price was higher than that of zinc (cadmia, as it
was called). But they soon became convinced that for fine
statues, at least, a small quantity of <i>tin was a necessity</i>.
Generally a zinc-brass was used for statues.</p>

<p>To prevent the metallic constituents from separating during
fusion, the mass was kept thick and pasty by putting in
old scrap bronze that had been often melted and contained
oxides. The smelters also knew that the metals, particularly
the tin, grew smaller every time it was melted, in consequence
of oxidation, slagging, and evaporation.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> The
Romans therefore added, besides the scrap bronze, an eighth
part of "silver lead," <i>i. e.</i>, a mixture of tin and lead.</p>

<p>Finally, in regard to the color of the castings, the ancients
collected valuable experiences. Cadmia (zinc ore) was used
to impart a golden color to the bronze.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Alloys rich in tin
were used for mirrors, and arsenic was employed to make
them white.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>The moulds originally employed were very primitive.
For simple objects a corresponding hole was dug in the
sand or clay soil. Complicated figures had to be formed in
clay, and the metal was cast in the clay mould. If the
mould was to serve for several castings, it had to be made
of baked clay, stone, brick, or other durable material. Organic
substances were mixed with the clay to prevent uneven
shrinkage and cracking.</p>

<p>Hollow casting is more difficult; first a core is formed
corresponding to the hollow in the figure; over this the figure
is formed, and over that the mantle, <i>i. e.</i>, the negative, or
mould. The latter is taken off, the figure taken away from
the core, the mantle replaced, and the metal poured into the
space between the core and the mantle. In this case it is
difficult to take off the mantle so clean and put it back so
accurately that the parts will not be disturbed. To avoid
this difficulty a wax model may be built on the core, and
the mantle formed over this, and then when the mould is
dry it can be heated and the wax melted out.</p>

<p>The Ph&oelig;nicians and Egyptians must have used one or
the other of these devices for their hollow castings.</p>

<p>The Greeks appear at first as pupils and imitators of
the Ph&oelig;nicians, but they soon surpassed their teachers in
forms as well as skill. They knew how to make their
moulds so perfect, and were able to place their cores so near
the mantles, that the castings were as thin as cardboard.
The master founders of to-day have not reached that perfection.</p>

<h3>HARD BRONZES OF THE ANCIENTS.</h3>

<p>We have already seen that only very pure bronze is suitable
for weapons and tools. It must be well "cooked," and
all sulphur, lead, and tin must be completely removed by
oxidation. The best results are obtained with from 8 to 12
per cent. of tin. A bronze having this composition is tenacious
and has a hardness of at least 4.</p>

<p>But the ancients were able to make much harder wrought
bronzes, as proved by our collections of weapons and tools.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we have no record of the devices employed;
but as we are able to make just such products and with
simple means, we may assume that the ancients employed
essentially the same methods. In our experience the following
conditions are essential for the manufacture of hard
bronze:</p>

<p>1. A particular treatment.</p>

<p>2. A small amount of phosphorus.</p>

<p>It is well known that normal weapon bronze, unlike iron,
is softened by rapid cooling, but is hardened by hammering
and rendered more compact.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>By repeating this process, the bronze gains in hardness
and strength, and sheet bronze becomes lamellar by hammering
or rolling, and hence acquires a certain elasticity.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
Besides, a slight admixture of iron or nickel seems advantageous,
but a slight amount of <i>phosphorus</i> is of the highest
importance. The latter point may be somewhat enlarged
on.</p>

<p>Ordinary bronze always contains <i>oxides</i> of copper and
tin, the quantity increasing with the number of times it is
recast. This oxide makes it pasty, so that the different
constituents do not separate, and the casting is homogeneous.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
This admixture of oxide does no harm for castings
in which strength is not demanded; but is of importance
for weapon bronze; the strength of which is considerably
diminished by the presence of the oxide.</p>

<p>In this respect a slight amount of phosphorus is an advantage
by preventing the formation of oxides, and consequently
the mixture remains a thin fluid until it begins to
solidify. On the other hand the metals are liable to separate.
This evil can be avoided if the alloy is allowed to cool nearly
to solidification <i>before casting</i>, and then cooled rapidly.
Under these circumstances a homogeneous alloy is obtained
that is nearly fifty per cent. stronger and about 200 per cent.
more tenacious than bronze that contains oxides. The hardness
and strength can be still further increased by chilling
and hammering.</p>

<p>Besides the indirect influence of phosphorus, it also has
the <i>direct</i> effect of hardening the bronze, because the compounds
of phosphorus with copper and tin have a very considerable
hardness. These facts, as well as the circumstance
that we possess antique bronzes of extraordinary hardness,
induced me, with the consent of Baron Sacken, to test the
hardness of the bronze weapons in the Vienna Cabinet of
Antiquities. Some hard pieces,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> were sent to Prof. Ludwig,
who followed the question with interest and agreed on
the method of making the analyses. The results were satisfactory.
The bronzes contained traces and up to one-fourth
per cent. of phosphorus. Its presence had prevented the
formation of oxides in these bronzes, and consequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6454">6454</span>
the weapons were of extraordinary hardness. It now remains
to ascertain how the ancients made these phosphorus-bronzes.
It is evident that the phosphorus was not put directly
into the metal, as is generally done at present. There
is another method so simple that we can assume that the
ancients employed it unintentionally. I refer to smelting
the copper or bronze with charcoal and any salt of phosphorus.
In this case the carbon would liberate phosphorus
from the phosphoric acid, and it would be taken up
by the melted metal.</p>

<p>The ancient metallurgists may have made use of the eruptive
rocks that contain apatite, and with which copper ores
are so often associated, for slag or flux, or the phosphates
that occur in the gangue may have been smelted along with
the ores; in both cases some phosphorus would get into the
metal. Finally it is not impossible that the ancients did not
put in phosphorus salts in some form. First of all I would
mention certain vegetable and animal substances that are
rich in phosphorus, especially <i>blood</i>,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> which was a favorite
with the old metallurgists and alchemists as having a powerful
enchantment. In each of the cases referred to some phosphorus
got into the metal, which thus acquired a considerable
hardness that could be increased in the well known manner
by chilling and hammering. Under certain circumstances
weapons and tools were made almost as hard as steel.</p>

<p>We can easily comprehend how bronze with these excellent
qualities could compete with steel at a time when rich
ores were still abundant, and thus it checked and restrained
the development of the iron industry.</p>

<h3 id="soaubta">SUMMARY OF ALLOYS USED BY THE ANCIENTS.</h3>

<p><i>Egypt</i>.&mdash;The wrought metal of the Egyptians is a pure
bronze with 6 to 14 per cent. of tin; 22 per cent. is an exceptional
case; 1 per cent. of iron is not rare.</p>

<p>The Egyptian cast metal is a plumbiferous bronze, with
4 to 11 per cent. tin, and 7 to 12 of lead; in one case 16 per
cent. tin; rarely 2 or 3 per cent. of zinc.</p>

<p><i>Assyria</i>.&mdash;The Assyrian bronze is very pure. It consists
of copper, 10 to 14 per cent. of tin, and traces of iron and
nickel; in one case 18 per cent. of tin.</p>

<p><i>Greece</i>.&mdash;Their wrought bronze for tools and weapons
contains 10 to 12 per cent. of tin and traces of nickel and cobalt;
in one case 18 per cent. of tin.</p>

<p>The cast bronze has in part the same composition as
wrought bronze. (Statues were rarely cast from pure copper.)
A small quantity of lead was sometimes added, especially
in later times, for statues and coin. The later coins
contained 5 to 7 per cent. lead, even 20 per cent. in exceptional
cases. Macedonian coins were of quite pure bronze.</p>

<p><i>Italy</i>.&mdash;Roman weapons (found at Hallstadt) contain 11 to
16 per cent. of tin, in some cases some zinc or lead, also
nickel and iron as impurities. Roman hatchets found in
Gaul contain 20 or 25 per cent. of tin. We have too few
analyses to give us a correct view of the matter, but on the
contrary we have numerous analyses of Roman castings.</p>

<p>Ornamental Roman bronze for flexible articles contains
less tin and lead. For less flexible objects bronze-brass
with 1 to 7 per cent. of tin, and 5 to 12 per cent. of zinc,
was employed; and for brittle but brilliant objects, like
buckles and mountings, an almost pure brass was used, with
15 to 24 per cent. of zinc and little or no tin. Lead is found
in all these alloys in small quantities, rarely more than 1
per cent.</p>

<p>The statues contain from 6 to 10 per cent. of tin, 0 to 3
per cent. zinc (in one case 14), and frequently from 10 to 12
per cent. of lead (once even 20), so that Roman statue
bronze may be called lead-bronze with zinc in it.</p>

<p>Coin metal varied its composition at different times. In
the days of the Republic a lead-bronze rich in tin (5 to 12
per cent.) was used. Under the early emperors brass or
impure copper came into use. After the time of Marcus
Aurelius an improvement is noticeable; the metal then in
use can be called stanniferous brass (1 to 4 of tin). Under
the Byzantines, coins were again struck from impure
copper.</p>

<p>These are the most important alloys of the Romans. In
general we may say that the zinc alloys held an important
place among the Romans.</p>

<p><i>Gaul</i>.&mdash;For weapons they employed a very pure bronze
with 2 to 15 per cent. of tin. Traces of nickel were rare.
Cast bronze contained a few per cent. of lead.</p>

<p><i>Britain</i>.&mdash;The weapon bronze contained from 7 to 14 per
cent. of tin. Cutting weapons not infrequently contain 1 to
3 per cent. of lead, and traces of iron. Ornament bronze
does not differ from weapon bronze. Traces of sulphur are
not rare, which points to the use of pyritical ores.</p>

<p><i>Alps</i>.&mdash;Swiss weapon bronze contains 8 to 13 per cent. of
tin (in one case even 16 per cent.), not infrequently 1 per
cent. of lead and traces of silver, very often ½ to 1 per cent.
of nickel and traces of iron (once as much as 3 per cent. of
iron). The Swiss ornamental bronze has the same composition.</p>

<p><i>Bavaria</i>.&mdash;Wrought bronze contains 8 to 12 per cent. of
tin (in tools 17 and even 25 per cent.), and often as much as
1 per cent. of lead, traces of nickel and cobalt. Ornamental
bronze has the same composition. A few per cent. of zinc
is also found.</p>

<p><i>Bohemia</i>.&mdash;The wrought metal contains 5 to 11 per cent.
of tin and traces of iron and sulphur, from which we conclude
that their ores contained pyrites. Their cast metal
also contains lead.</p>

<p><i>North Germany</i>.&mdash;The wrought metal contains 8 to 16 per
cent. of tin, with frequently 1 per cent. of nickel. A sword
contained only 5 per cent. of nickel, an ax 24 per cent.
These are exceptions. The ornament bronzes contain also
a few per cent. of lead; exceptionally, a considerable
quantity of zinc. The ornamental metal in the Rhine region,
Nassau, and Hesse contains 5 to 15 per cent. of zinc
with the same of tin. At one time a rich bronze is used, at
another quite pure brass, and then a bronze-like brass.</p>

<p><i>Denmark</i>.&mdash;The Danes employed the same metal for weapons
that they did for ornaments. It contained 5 to 12 per
cent. of tin, and most of it 1 per cent. of zinc, but
never lead; in one case only 2 per cent. of tin. Nickel and
cobalt often occur, ½ per cent. of each; iron in traces.</p>

<p><i>Russia</i>.&mdash;The Russian weapon bronze contains from 9 to
16 per cent. of tin, and traces of nickel. Arrows contain a
little lead, up to 5 per cent. Ornament bronze frequently
contains in addition a few per cent. of zinc.</p>

<p>The ornamental bronze of the Baltic provinces is a brass
containing 15 to 20 per cent. of zinc, 3 to 4 per cent. of lead,
and 1 to 2 per cent. of tin.</p>

<p>In Russia, as in other countries, the brass alloys belong to
a later epoch; in older times real bronze was chiefly used
for ornaments as well as other purposes.&mdash;<i>Translated from

<h2 id="THE_BIG_TREES_OF_CALIFORNIA">THE BIG TREES OF CALIFORNIA.</h2>

<p>We have previously spoken of the large <i>Sequoiæ</i> of California,
which have justly a universal celebrity, and shall
now render our remarks upon the subject completer.</p>

<p>If there is any sight that can throw us into mute contemplation
and show us the littleness of our own nature, it is
assuredly that of high mountains like Mont Blanc, or waterfalls
like Niagara. But yet we do not at the first instant
take in all the grandeur of these, but must make the tour
of Mont Blanc, or pass under the falls of Niagara and
study it at different points in order to obtain a just idea
of such marvels. And so it is with regard to the vegetable
curiosities of the Sierra Nevada, in California.</p>

<p>When points for comparison fail us, our eye, one of the
most imperfect of instruments, never gives us an accurate
idea of objects, and it is for this reason that we have
placed upon the annexed figure a five-story Paris house,
drawn to the same scale as the "Grizzly Giant," one of the
most ancient <i>Sequoiæ</i> of the Mariposa Grove, in California.
This true vegetable giant is 105 feet in diameter at the base,
and 69 feet at 13 feet from the ground. It has, like many
of the <i>Sequoiæ</i> that surround it, been struck by lightning,
but, in spite of that, its total height is still more than 300
feet. Some of its branches are more than six feet in diameter.
Those who have seen our old oaks in the forest of
Fontainebleau will be able to compare the effect of time and
lightning upon such venerable relics, these in California
being possibly contemporaries of the Roman Empire. A
few of the trees have been razed to the base, and serve as
floors for dancing halls, while others, that have fallen, have
been cut lengthwise and serve as bowling alleys. What especially
distinguishes the wonderful region in which these
<i>Sequoiæ</i> grow is the cleanness and beauty of the plains
upon which they are found. In the virgin forests of South
America, under the influence of a warm and damp atmosphere,
the vegetation is so rank that, in order to open a
passage, one is obliged to use an ax on the vines and thickets
of interlaced plants. In California, on the contrary, the
<i>Sequoiæ</i>, which are situated at an altitude of from 5,000 to
7,000 feet above the Pacific Ocean, are easily accessible.
The routes are almost traced by nature, dangerous animals
are rare, the summer temperature is delicious there, and
hotels are everywhere being erected, as in Switzerland, to
serve as a retreat and promenading place for tourists.&mdash;<i>La
Nature.</i></p>

It is often desirable to make one of the apertures twice the diameter
of the rest; it causes a greater intensity to be given to one image, and
that facilitates the calculation of time, while it furnishes points for the
comparison of the movements of the lower limbs with those of the arms.</p></div>

Abbe Moigno, in his treatise on telegraphy, assigns the date of
1838 to this publication; but Mr. Zetsche (<i>d.c.</i>) gives it as 1811. We
shall consider the latter as the true date; for, in 1838, there was no
reason for publishing Soemmering's memoir, and especially for proposing
improvements in his apparatus.</p></div>

The largest bronze statue of modern times is the "Bavaria" in
Munich, which is 20 meters high and weighs 80 tons. It consists of
12 pieces and cost about a quarter of a million dollars.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">19</a>
When a bronze is remelted six times the percentage of tin is reduced
to half the original (Dumas). The evaporation of the metal can be
shown by holding a cold plate on it while melted. Tin is immediately
deposited on it.</p></div>

They usually made a copper and zinc alloy, but it is possible that
they also understood the art of embedding the casting in zinc ore (calamine)
and heating strongly, whereby the surface of the metal was "cemented"
and colored.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">21</a>
On examining a broken surface of an antique mirror, it will be seen
that only the outside is white. It is probable that the finished mirror was
embedded in some arsenical substance and heated, which cemented
and colored the surface.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">22</a>
Uchatius makes his famous hard bronze by cooling and hydraulic
pressure. Bronzes with 8 to 12 per cent. of tin are most benefited by this
process. Bronzes with very little tin in them are but little affected by
chilling and hammering (Riche). Alloys that are hard already, such as
bronzes rich in tin and phosphorus, become too brittle and useless by repeated
hammering.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">23</a>
When a cast sheet of inelastic bronze or brass is hammered or rolled,
it "feathers."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">24</a>
The Romans preferred to put in some bronze that had been repeatedly
cast.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">25</a>
One piece was scarcely scratched by feldspar, another by quartz.
The Greek and Roman weapons in the Berlin Museum were tested as to
hardness by Dr. Von Dechend at the suggestion of the Director-General,
Von Schone. All of them were scratched by fluorspar; there were no
hard bronzes among them. If the races of <i>classical</i> antiquity were not
acquainted with hard bronze, it is easy to see why they soon began to use
iron, in contrast with the Semitic-Hamitic races.</p></div>

Excrements were also much used by the alchemists and pharmacists
of the middle ages.</p></div>
